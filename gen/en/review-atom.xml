<p>The point of reference for Kombucha fans and lover.</p>
<p>The author was able to gather and share with readers tons of information such as: applications history details, hints for production, alternative recipes and He did it easily and in a comprehensible way.</p>
<p>References are from all the different cultures that have in common this special beverage in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Useful read to both beginners and experts. It is also helpful for inquiring minds that does not want to produce the tea by themselves.</p>
<p>I really appreciated quotes and the author’s philosophical thoughts that go along with the book.</p>]]></summary>
