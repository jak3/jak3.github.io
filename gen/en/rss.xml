<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“You see! Learning gongfu is the same. Looking is not as real as feeling. And feeling is still not good enough to become an expert. To be an expert, you must know how to create instead of just learning and selling. The art is alive and created from deep feeling. If the feeling of creation is shallow, the art created will also be shallow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If ten fingers grab one thing, you will have it for sure. If ten fingers grab two things, you may have it. However, if ten fingers tried to grab ten things, you will lose everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gongfu just means energy (gong) and time (fu). Anything that needs a lot of time, energy, and patience to do well is gongfu.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When the goal is achieved, it is wise to retire”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the crucial keys to success is persistence. When you have a strong will, confidence, and persistence, you surely will be successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want a calm and peaceful life, you have to understand you get what you deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The crucial key to success is not how smart you are but your level of self-discipline. Those who have discipline can accomplish any task they face.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A wise man learns from the past, proceeds carefully in the present, and thinks calmly about the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of our tasks must be accomplished slowly and gradually and require patience to finish.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A wise man knows how to pick up and also how to drop it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to experience and understand the meaning of life. This is how the spirit grows. It does not matter what you are learning and perfecting; as long as you continue to try hard and have patience, you will soon reach a high level where few can match you. Through this self-conquering process, your spirit will grow. Once you have reached spiritual enlightenment, all of the skills you have mastered will become empty. My White Crane master always said, “Your self is the biggest enemy of you. If you can conquer your self, you will conquer any difficulty in front of you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Often we are interested in many things, but our time is limited. If we spend all our time pursuing all the interests we have, we will not accomplish much. Everything we learn will remain shallow. Therefore, once you have chosen the one thing you are really interested in, you should stay on it and achieve the final goal you have set.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Those who are satisfied are always happy” (知足常樂).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we see something that bothers us and affects us deeply. Later, we may realize it was only our imagination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep walking until your legs no longer obey you. So, when you become unable to walk, sit down with your outward, then with your inward, then with your heart, and then with your essence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah! Grant us the wakefulness of the vigilant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In every craft seek the expertise of its experts”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>endure with patience whatever destiny brings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(prayer and peace be on our Prophet and on all prophets and angels)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>him) about whom Allah (mighty and glorified is He) said, “And We prevented from him all wet-</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His love has become true, and when love becomes true the barriers of formality vanish”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>occupy yourself with purifying your heart from everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The love of Allah (mighty and glorified is He) comes only after observing the commandments, refraining from the prohibitions, being satisfied with whatever one gets, and being content with the divine decree.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When someone does not know his status, the decrees of destiny show him his status”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone who enters inside has something to surprise him. Allah (high is He) said, “And be pious to Allah and Allah will teach you”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The law refines the behaviour at the door, whereas knowledge refines the behaviour inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the person looks at his faults, he accomplishes perfection, but when he looks at his perceived perfection, he reaps deficiency. Reverse your actions to succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah, correct our prayer of supplication to you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Practise renunciation, be content, offer thanks, be satisfied with your Lord (mighty and glorified is He), and do not be satisfied with yourself. Think well of others, abandon holding a poor opinion of others, and do not hold yourself in high esteem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Endure with patience the rulings of the law so that knowledge will be unveiled to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Patience to faith is like the head to the body”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone comes to know Allah (mighty and glorified is He), his tongue will stop moving, his heart will start to speak, his innermost being will become pure and serene, and his status will raise in His sight. He will feel intimacy and find comfort with Him and he will find Him sufficient for all his needs, to the exclusion of everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You will not be able to perform righteous deeds with sincerity unless you practise the curtailment of hopes. You will be able to curtail hopes only by remembering death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If He wants you for a certain purpose, He prepares you for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is at times of dissatisfaction not at times of satisfaction that the lover becomes identifiable from the hater.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not be dissatisfied with what destiny brings. No one can turn it back or prevent it from taking place. Everything will come to pass regardless of who is satisfied and who is not. Your involvement in this world requires the right intention, otherwise, you will be hated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Appoint one hour for this world, one hour for the hereafter, one hour for yourself, one hour for your family, and all of the remaining hours for your Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stand steadfast, for nothing that is destined for others will come your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You who have wishes, make every effort to come to have none! One of the people of Allah was once asked, “What do you long for?” He replied, “To long for nothing”. Everything depends on being satisfied with the divine decree, giving up the very act of wanting, and casting down the heart in the hands of its Transformer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O You who have wishes, make every effort to come to have none! One of the people of Allah was once asked, “What do you long for?” He replied, “To long for nothing”. Everything depends on being satisfied with the divine decree, giving up the very act of wanting, and casting down the heart in the hands of its Transformer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn to Him in all of your serious problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the family of each of you has gone to sleep and the creatures’ voices have fallen silent, let him purify himself and place his forehead on the ground, draw near [to Allah], repent, apologise, confess his sins, beg for His favour, ask Him for his needs, and complain to Him about everything that is causing him grief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O young man, do not occupy yourself with washing the clothes of your body while leaving the clothes of your heart dirty! Wash the heart first and then wash the clothes. Combine both acts of washing, both acts of purification. Wash your clothes clean of dirt and wash your heart clean of sins. Do not be overconfident about anything, for your Lord is a “doer of what He wills”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He grants his lower self some of its needs so that it calms down and does not hurt him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A proper diet is the source of healing, while filling one’s stomach with food and leaving the body to eat what it is used to are the source of disease”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Work on purifying your heart first, for this is an obligatory duty, and then move on to the acquisition of knowingness because if you miss the root your engrossment with the branch will not be accepted of you. What benefit would the purity of the limbs and senses have when combined with the impurity of the heart? Purify your limbs and senses with the Sunna and your heart by applying the Qur’an. Protect your heart so that your limbs and senses will be protected. Every vessel exudes its contents. Whatever is in your heart will ooze out to your limbs and senses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have accustomed your lower self to eating oat bread but it asks you for honey, you must feed it barley bread until its only wish becomes that you return it to eating oat bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If Allah (mighty and glorified is He) enables me I will do!” He argues citing destiny where his repentance is concerned but he does not use destiny as an argument where his lustful desires and pleasures are concerned, while standing on the foot of procrastination, hesitating between “yes” and “no”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“O tranquil soul! Return to your Lord well-pleased and well-pleasing”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah, include us among those who renounced everything other than You! Make us seek You under all circumstances</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning, when faith is still weak, [the person says], “There is no God save Allah (lā ilāha illā Allah)” (47.19), but at the end, when faith has become strong, [the person says], “There is no God save You (lā ilāha illā Anta)” (21.87), as he addresses One (mighty and glorified is He) who is present and seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of the Day of Resurrection and experience it before it takes place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be no good in you until you come to know your lower self, prevent it from getting what it wants, and allow it only what it deserves. At this point it will feel secure with the heart, the heart will feel secure with the innermost being, and the innermost being will feel secure with the True One (mighty and glorified is He).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O young man, make sure that you have only one concern. This comes about only after renouncing the unlawful, then renouncing the permissible, and then renouncing the absolutely lawful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>remember Him with the tongue of your heart, innermost being, and essence, and then with the tongue of your outward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Place the feet of your heart and your innermost being firmly in His presence and give up all preoccupations with this world and the hereafter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This heart will not become sound and will not succeed until it gives up every beloved, cuts off every object of attachment, and renounces every creature. Give up and you will be rewarded with much better than what you abandoned.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Renunciation is here, piety is here, sincerity is here”, and he pointed to his breast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When anything poses a problem for you, ask the people of the law outwardly and your heart inwardly. The Prophet (Allah’s prayer and peace be on him) once said to a righteous man, “Consult your heart even if the legal experts have offered you advice”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the heart agreed, this is a welcome agreement, but if it disagreed, follow its ruling and ignore the ruling of anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am following the truth, erect my edifice, raise it high, and speed up the guidance of creatures through me. O Allah, raise our hearts to you! How long will this tiredness last? When will the cares of the heart end? When will we enjoy the banquet on the roof of the palace of nearness, looking from its balconies at Your creation? “And Allah presents parables for people”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The heart will speak to the innermost being, the innermost being to the private life, the private life to the essence, the essence to the kernel, the kernel to the consciousness. At this stage, its speech to the hearts will be like seeds that are sown in a land that is good, soft, and not saline, so they will grow into green plants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even if a believer was on the top of a mountain, Allah (high is He) will appoint for him a knowledgeable scholar to teach him”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the knower renounces the hereafter he says to it, “Get out of my way for I am seeking the door of the True One (mighty and glorified is He). You and this world are one and the same in my eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah, open for us the door of Your nearness! Include us among the people who obey You. Include us among your few individuals and soldiers. Give us a seat at the mat where Your favour is served, give us a drink of Your intimacy, and “give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and protect us from the torment of the Fire”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be sound in your private life and then you will be eloquent in your public life. If you are sound in this world you, will</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah, grant us good behaviour with You under all circumstances and with the righteous of Your servants and “give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and protect us from the torment of the Fire”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Allah”. “Say ‘Allah’ then leave them alone” (6.91)! Say, “He who created me, so He guides me”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Prophet, do talk to the creatures about the favours of your Lord (mighty and glorified is He) and His generosity to you!” It is an obligation of the walī to conceal and of the Prophet to disclose. The walī’s disclosure is an action of Allah (mighty and glorified is He). If he discloses his favours he gets afflicted and deprived of his spiritual state. But if his disclosure is caused by Allah’s (mighty and glorified is He) action, he does not get subjected to rebuke and reproach because that was not his action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Two favours that many people fail to appreciate: good health and free time”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every truth that is not supported by the law is mere infidelity”, meaning that the law should be perfected first and this will be the foundations on which the edifice should be erected afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are then promoted from one degree to another, from one book to another, from one abode to another, and from one form of remembrance to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who does not act with sincerity will not earn a single atom of the nearness to Allah (mighty and glorified is He).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They have renounced every created thing, so their hearts have been given the favour of “‘be,’ and it is”. As long as this outward thing is in your hand and your heart is embracing it, you will have nothing of the favour of “‘be,’ and it is”. One of the people of Allah was asked, “Where do you obtain your food from?” He replied, “From the big threshing floor”. It was asked, “What is the big threshing floor?” He replied, “‘be,’ and it is”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They have renounced every created thing, so their hearts have been given the favour of “‘be,’ and it is”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to worldly matters, look to those who are inferior to you, whereas with matters of the hereafter look up to those who are superior to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give up your illusion. This business [of spiritual attainment] cannot be achieved by pretence, wishful thinking, and tongue-wagging. If you are sitting in front of this plate and at this spring, then eat and drink, and feed and offer drinks to others. But if you have only heard of it, then keep silent. Do not talk about something you have not seen. Do not invite people to someone else’s party.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah, grant us the goodness of this day and protect us from its evil, and grant us the same for all nights and days! Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Allah (high is He) wants you to do something, He prepares you for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O Allah, make us satisfied with Your decree, grant us patience with Your affliction, and enable us to thank You for Your favour! We ask You to give us Your full favour, the permanence of well-being, and steadfastness in love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be careful when you ask for something if you really have to ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus, the son of Mary, and John, the son of Zechariah, (prayer and peace be on our Prophet and them) used to glorify the Lord in the wilderness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure that your heart, not your clothes, is the abode of your righteousness. Dress as common people do but do not do what they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for those who are sincere in their belief in the oneness of God, their cells are their hearts. Their austerity is imposed on their lower selves, passions, and natural inclination</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O servant of God, stand firm in your places and do not rush! Come on the foot of truthfulness to knock at the door of the True One (mighty and glorified is He) and do not leave until the door is opened for you and processions have come out to welcome you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remind us of Your remembrance, be kind to us in Your actions, draw us close to your nearness, and make our hearts feel Your intimacy. Protect us from the evil of Your countries and Your servants, and from the evil of every moving creature that You hold by the forelock.21 Protect us from the evil of the evildoers and the scheming of the infidels. Include us among Your party who is travelling to You, seeking the way to You, calling others to You, submitting with humility to You, and treating with arrogance those who are arrogant with You and with the believers of Your creatures. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He put on shepherds’ clothes and spent the night and day with the sheep, with those that do not speak. In the wilderness, he learned renunciation and solitude, so his heart was purified, and he matured in those years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And whoever is pious to Allah, He will appoint for him a way out, and He will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever puts his trust in Allah, He is sufficient for him” (65.2-3).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“So woe to those who pray but are unmindful of their prayer” (107.4-5)?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Observe the five daily prayers at their prescribed times. Perform them with total adherence to their conditions and requirements. Do not perform them while you are absent-minded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Put their sayings into practice first and then speak so that your speech will be a chick of your deeds and the fruit of the tree of your works. This business is not achieved by merely visiting righteous people and memorizing their words, but by putting what they say into practice, behaving with ultimate politeness in their company, and thinking well of them, in all circumstances. The layperson is rewarded in proportion to the steps he takes with his feet, whereas one of the elite is rewarded in proportion to his spiritual aspiration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O hearts, listen! O eloquent ones, listen! O sensible ones, listen!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Acquire knowledge outwardly and work sincerely inwardly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge is like the sword, and action is like the hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“O Allah, I thank You through my inability to thank You!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>O learners, knowledge is not in itself the goal, but the aim is its fruit!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I see Allah (mighty and glorified is He) as the Giver, not myself. You are given gifts in proportion to your aspiration, and gifts are withheld from you also in proportion to your spiritual aspiration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be content with as little food as you need for survival and as little clothing as you need to cover your private parts. If anything else was destined for you, it will certainly come your way at the appointed time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>who worships Allah with ignorance causes more damage than good”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be content with whatever has been allotted to you by your Lord (mighty and glorified is He); be satisfied with it. The person who endures with patience will achieve spiritual attainment. When the person endures with patience, his heart will become rich and his poverty will be removed. You have to resort to solitude so that you can worship with sincerity, for loneliness is better than bad companions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This business cannot be achieved by fasting by day, keeping vigil to worship by night, and practising austerity in diet and dress, yet with the existence of the lower self, vagaries, natural inclination, wretchedness, ignorance, and interests in creatures. This business cannot be done without His guidance. Woe to you! Act with sincerity and detach yourself, for there may be some hidden things that you are not aware of. Be truthful and then you will arrive and become near to Him. Raise your aspiration and then you will rise high. Surrender and then you will be saved. Comply and then you will be granted success. Be satisfied and then you will be satisfied with [by Him]. Hurry up and act and then the True One (mighty and glorified is He) will complete for you what you set out to do. O Allah, take charge of our affairs in this world and the hereafter, do not assign us to ourselves or any of your creatures, and “give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and protect us from the torment of the Fire”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“And those who strive in Our cause, We will certainly guide them to Our ways”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The real light is the light of the hearts and the real cleanness is the cleanness of the hearts, innermost beings, and private lives. If your heart and private life are unclean, what would the cleanness of your outward benefit you? Even if you bathed yourself a thousand times each day, nothing of the dirt of your heart would disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Strive and then guidance will come to you. It will not come to you because of you, yet you have to be involved. It will not come about through you alone. Make a start and others will then come and complete your work for you. Everything is in the hand of Allah (mighty and glorified is He), so do not ask for anything from anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They demand outwardly but have mercy inwardly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prevent your tongues from talking about things that do not concern you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remembering death is a remedy for the disease of the lower selves and food and benefits for the hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your words reveal what is in your heart. The tongue is the speaker of the heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is plenty of water all around me and I am like a frog, so I cannot speak of what I know. I wait for the water to seep away and then I speak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not what you see, hear, think, or feel; you have these experiences. Perhaps most essentially, you are who is aware. You are always at the center of your multidimensional universe of experience, but you are not always consciously aware of yourself. Briefly repeat the exercise with the following difference: At the same time you attend to each of the various aspects of your experience, be aware that it is you who is noticing these things</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>use your collection of dreams to find peculiarities (dreamsigns) that appear often enough in your dreams to be reliable signposts of the dream state. Your list of dreamsigns will help you succeed with the lucid dream induction</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in lucid dreams, estimated dream time is very nearly equal to clock time; that is, it takes just as long to do something in a dream as it does to actually do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>dreaming of doing something is equivalent to actually doing it. This finding explains why dreams seem so real. To the brain, they are real.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the tendency of our culture has been to ignore dreams, dream experiences are as real to us as waking life. If we seek to improve our lives, we would do well to include our dream lives in our efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>dream—emotional reactions are important clues in the dream world. Record anything unusual, the kinds of things that would never occur in waking life:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was dreaming! With the realization of this fact, the quality of the dream changed in a manner very difficult to convey to one who has not had this experience. Instantly, the vividness of life increased a hundredfold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People don’t become lucid more often in the presence of dreamsigns because of a normal tendency to rationalize and confabulate—they make up stories to explain what is going on, or they think, “There must be some explanation.” Indeed, there must be, but too rarely does such a halfawake dreamer realize what it actually is</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four primary categories. The first one, inner awareness, refers to things that dreamers (egos) perceive as happening within themselves, such as thoughts and feelings. The other three categories</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>people naturally seem to categorize their experiences in dreams. There are four primary categories. The first one, inner awareness, refers to things that dreamers (egos) perceive as happening within themselves, such as thoughts and feelings. The other three categories (action, form, and context) classify elements of the dream environment. The action category includes the activities and motions of everything in the dream world—the dream ego, other characters, and objects. Form refers to the shapes of things, people, and places, which are often bizarre and frequently transform in dreams. The final category is context. Sometimes in dreams the combination of elements—people, places, actions, or things, is odd, although there is nothing inherently strange about any item by itself. Such strange situations are context dreamsigns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exercise Without Movement by Swami Rama</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge, then, is how to activate the critical faculty before bed so that it remains sufficiently primed to function properly when it is needed to explain some strange occurrence in a dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is done by asking yourself whether or not you are dreaming while you are awake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any time you come in contact with something that resembles a dreamsign, test your state. Whenever anything surprising or unlikely occurs or anytime you experience unusually powerful emotions, or anything dream like, test your state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Am I dreaming or awake?” Don’t just automatically ask the question and mindlessly reply, “Obviously, I’m awake, “ or you will do the same thing when you actually are dreaming. Look around for any oddities or inconsistencies that might indicate you are dreaming. Think back to the events of the last several minutes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The moral here is not to take anyone else’s word for it: test your own reality!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, the best test is the following: find some writing and read it once (if you can), look away, then reread it, checking to see if it stays the same. Every time I have tried this in my own lucid dreams the writing has mutated in some way. The words may no longer make sense or the letters may turn into hieroglyphics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>attempt to think of all our experiences as dreams and to try to maintain unbroken continuity of consciousness between the two states of sleep and waking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Practice the exercise a dozen times or more during the day at your selected times and also whenever you find yourself in a situation which is in any way dreamlike, for example, whenever something surprising or odd happens or you experience inappropriately strong emotions or find your mind (and especially memory) strangely unresponsive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any trouble remembering what just happened? If so, you may be dreaming. Read some text twice. Don’t conclude that you are awake unless you have solid proof (for example, the writing stays the same every time you look at it).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After having satisfied yourself that you’re awake, tell yourself, “Okay, I’m not dreaming, now. But if I were, what would it be like?” Imagine as vividly as possible that you are dreaming. Intently imagine that what you are perceiving (hearing, feeling, smelling, or seeing) is a dream:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Decide in advance what you would like to do in your next lucid dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>taking a critical look at the nature of reality a few times a day is an enjoyable habit to cultivate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you establish a systematically critical attitude in your waking life, sooner or later you will decide to try a state test when you are actually dreaming. And then you will be awake in your dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When facing the challenge of remembering to do something, we can increase the likelihood of success by (1) being strongly motivated to remember and (2) forming mental associations between what we want to remember to do and the future circumstances in which we intend to do it. These associations are greatly strengthened by the mnemonic (memory aid) of visualizing yourself doing what you intend to remember.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>before attempting MILD, you need to prove to yourself that you can indeed remember to do things while awake. If you are like most people, you are used to relying on external reminders and therefore need practice in remembering intentions using only your own mental power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your goal is to notice the next occurrence of each event, at which time you will perform a state test: “Am I dreaming?” So, if your target is, “The next time I hear a dog bark, “ when you hear this next, note it and do a state test. You are aiming to notice the target once—the next time it happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, write down how many of the four targets you succeeded in noticing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>strategies for inducing lucid dreams by carrying an idea from the waking world into the dream, such as an intention to comprehend the dream state, a habit of critical state testing, or the recognition of a dreamsign. These strategies are intended to stimulate a dreamer to become lucid within a dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more lucid dreams you have, the easier it will become to have them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perception (what we see, hear, feel, etc.) depends to a great extent on expectation. In a certain sense, what we perceive is what we most expect. Expectation takes many forms; one of the most important is context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another important influence on perception is recent experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Personal interests, occupations, and personality can strongly influence people’s experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Expectation biases perception in the direction of how you think things really are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another important factor that influences perception is motivation. Our motivations are our reason for doing things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“What bread looks like depends upon whether you are hungry or not.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Strong emotions motivate behavior and influence perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a motive or emotion biases your perception toward seeing things as you wish them to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“a kind of informal, private unarticulated theory about the nature of events, objects, or situations which we face. The total set of schemas we have available for interpreting our world, “ writes the Stanford psychologist David Rumelhart, “in a sense constitutes our private theory of the nature of reality.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We assume a great deal about the world, much more than we observe about it directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>inferences are only limited by creativity and stamina, that Nasrudin was serious at the same time as he was joking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there are schemas for everything.’’Just as theories can be about the grand or the small, “ writes Rumelhart, “so schemas can represent knowledge at all levels—from ideologies and cultural truths to knowledge about what constitutes an appropriate sentence in our language to knowledge about the meaning of a particular word to knowledge about what patterns of [sound] are associated with what letters of the alphabet.”^ Schemas are connected to one another. A certain schema, such as “spectator at an opera, “ automatically brings into play a great number of other schemas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we construct a dream world we expect that it will resemble past worlds we have experienced. Thus, dream worlds are almost always equipped with gravity, space, time, and air. Likewise, recent experience influences dreaming in the same way it influences waking perception. Freud called this “day residue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Last Wave (a film about dreaming).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your assumptions are mistaken and, as a result, your schema fails to model the world accurately, what should happen is a process of theory revision and schema modification that the renowned psychologist Jean Piaget called “accommodation.” Your accommodated schema will now better fit the facts, and you will have slightly more knowledge than you did before. If we always accommodate our schemas to new information, our worlds will continuously expand as our schemas become increasingly comprehensive, adaptable, and intelligent. Unfortunately, people don’t always accommodate their schemas in the face of new information. . We may not even see the new information, exactly because it doesn’t fit the assumptions of our schemas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bird schema, we may suffer from the same self-perpetuating myopia when we attempt to reduce new concepts to fit our current understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to become a lucid dreamer, however, you must be prepared to accept the possibility that a “strange pigeon” may be a bird of an altogether different feather, and that sometimes the explanation for anomalies is that you are dreaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In dreams even more than elsewhere in life, if you think you can’t, you can’t. As Henry Eord said, “Believe you can’t, believe you can. Either way you’re right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As long as you are actively and perceptually engaged with the dream world, you are less likely to make the transition to the waking state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of focusing on something in the dream in order to prevent awakening has independently occurred to several other lucid dreamers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should dream spinning decrease the likelihood of awakening? Several factors are probably involved. One of these may be neurophysiological. Information about head and body movement, monitored by the vestibular system of the inner ear (which helps you to keep your balance), is closely integrated with visual information by the brain to produce an optimally stable picture of the world. Because of this integration of information, the world doesn’t appear to move whenever you move your head, even though the image of the world on the retina of your eye moves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the following advice for dreamers who have just awakened but yearn to return to their lucid dreams: “Eie very still—don’t move a muscle! Relax and wait. The dream will return. I’ve had dozens of lucid dreams in a row with this method.”^</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I decide I want to awaken from a lucid dream, I simply lie down on the nearest dream bed, couch, or cloud, shut my dream eyes, and “go to sleep.” The usual result is that I immediately wake up, but sometimes I only dream that I wake up, and when I realize Fm still dreaming, I try again to wake up “for real, “ sometimes succeeding at once, but sometimes only after an amusing sequence of false awakenings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think, daydream, or otherwise withdraw your attention from the dream, and you are very likely to awaken.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul Tholey has experimented with fixation on a stationary point during lucid dreams. He found that gaze fixation caused the fixation point to blur, followed by dissolution of the entire dream scene and an awakening within four to twelve seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>make sure you have your problem or wish firmly in mind before sleeping.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your intention should be the last thing you think of before falling asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“vivid, imagined events produce innervation in our muscles that is similar to that produced by the actual physical execution of the event.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is, however, an important difference between dreamed action and imagined action. When we are awake, the neural impulses to the muscles created by imagining an action must be somehow attenuated to keep us from acting out what we imagine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>whole, healthy, and holy come from the same root</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to the ideal of health. It is no accident that the words whole, healthy, and holy come from the same root</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the words whole, healthy, and holy come from the same root</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving wholeness requires reconciling all aspects of one’s personality. Integration, however, need not be only a matter of repairing malfunctional relationships between the different parts of the personality. It can also be a natural developmental process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dreaming is an endogenous process of psychological growth, change, and transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that evil, like beauty, may be in the eye of the beholder. As the Afghan Sufi master Hakim Sanai observed eight hundred years ago: If you want the mirror to reflect the face, hold it straight and keep it polished bright; although the sun does not begrudge its light, when seen in a mist it only looks like glass; and creatures comelier than angels even seem in a dagger to have devil’s faces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if anything appears in your dream world that causes you discomfort, you can take its presence as an opportunity to investigate that problem and see if you can resolve or accept whatever it is that repels you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is important that you firmly set your intention to do so while awake. Otherwise, you may find that in the emotional heat of the dream, you will lack the willpower to face your fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindlessness, in contrast, is a state of reduced awareness, in which people process information from their environments in an automatic manner. They rely on habitual categories and distinctions without reference to possible novel aspects of the information, resulting in behavior that is rulegoverned and rigid. According to Eanger’s research, “much of the behavior we assume to be performed mindfully instead is enacted rather mindlessly;… unless there is a welllearned script to follow or effortful response to make, people may process only a minimal amount of information to get them through their day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two men looked out from prison bars; One saw mud, the other stars.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypnotic dreamers are almost always at least partly lucid in their dreams, and in the deeper states, like lucid dreamers, they experience imagery as real. Deeply</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My findings are that healing is possible in lucid dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the manner in which we perceive the world may not be inadequate, given the senses we are employing; it may simply be irrelevant because we are employing the wrong senses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“a person must control his thoughts in a dream. The training of this alertness… will produce great benefits for the individual. Everyone should apply himself to the attainment of this ability of such great value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Experiences we gain from practices we do during our dream time can then be brought into our daytime experience. For example, we can learn to change the frightening images we see in our dreams into peaceful forms. Using the same process, we can transmute the negative emotions we feel during the daytime into increased awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A further step leads him to the knowledge that the essential nature of form and of all things perceived by the senses in the wakingstate are as equally unreal as their reflexes in the dreamstate, both states alike being sangsaric, “ that is to say, illusory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that the dream state and waking state both use the same perceptual process to arrive at mental representations or models of the world. These models, whether of the dream or physical world, are only models. As such they are illusions, not the things they are representing, just as the map is not the territory, and the menu is not the meal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nasrudin went into a bank to cash a check. The teller asked him if he could identify himself. “Yes, I can, “ Nasrudin replied, taking out a mirror with which he scrutinizes his features. “That’s me, all right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a monk boasts to Nasrudin, “I am so detached that I never think of myself, only of others. “ Nasrudin replies, “Well, I am so objective that I can look at myself as if I were another person; so I can afford to think of myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The less we identify with who we think we are, the more likely we are to discover who we really are. In this regard, the Sufi master Tariqavi wrote: When you have found yourself you can have knowledge. Until then you can only have opinions. Opinions are based on habit and what you conceive to be convenient.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The way people approach seeking the Divine also affects their experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s ordinarily very difficult to conceive how you might not yet be fully awake, unless you have had experiences</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not regard lucid dreaming as a complete path to enlightenment. Perhaps in the hands of the Tibetan Buddhists, with the right guidance, and combined with other necessary techniques, seekers could use lucid dreaming to take them to their spiritual goals. However, I see it primarily as a signpost pointing to the possibility of higher consciousness, a reminder that there is more to life than people are ordinarily aware of, and an inspiration to seek a guide who knows the way.</p>

<p>The hypothalamus controls the basic bodily functions of homeostasis. The midbrain and amygdala control the core self, or what we perceive as being the ego. The cortex is the autobiographical self, which contains language, speech, and memory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if the unconscious mind doesn’t want us to be aware of the experiences in our dream, we never will. Most lucid dreaming techniques build a relationship with the unconscious so that we can become more aware of unconscious material in the dream state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Unconscious is not unconscious; only the conscious is unconscious of what the unconscious is conscious of. —FRANCES JEFFREY</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we do this? Simply by noticing differences between the dream world and waking reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindfulness meditation asks us to allow thoughts to play out and be observed without attachment to any emotions that may arise in reaction to them. Practice nonattachment enough and your mind will learn that errant thoughts are not important, gradually becoming less preoccupied with mundane drama.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, become attentive to your surroundings. That means smelling the air, touching objects, and, especially, focusing on things in the real world that may appear different in the dream world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>look for anything about it that seems strange, while asking yourself, Am I dreaming? This process is like reciting a mantra, a repeating system of words that brings us awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To improve on this technique, immediately after you wake up from a dream, identify the differences between waking reality and the dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>were like in the dream, and ask yourself how they compare with the real world. As you get into the habit of noticing how the dream world compares with waking reality, you can attain a higher level of awareness in both waking and dreaming states.</p>

<p>Ann Faraday explains that the unconscious is unable to read our minds or to know what we are thinking. We must audibly say things or write things down for our unconscious to get the message. The final part of The Talk makes a huge impact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hippocampus is essential to dreams because of its participation in converting shortterm memories (the experience of the dream itself) into long-term memories in other regions of the brain so that when we wake, we can remember the dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Acetylcholine and glutamate seem to be two of the heavy hitters when it comes to building new memories of all kinds. Further research points to hormones as another huge part of the equation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing Acetylcholine and glutamate seems reduce memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The balance of this oxytocin-melatonin-serotonin cocktail may contribute to the fluctuations in our ability to remember dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Practices such as dream journaling, listening to binaural beats, and reality checks may also affect the cortisol levels in the hippocampus, which may be why these practices seem to improve dream recall.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>High levels of cortisol can result in hippocampus dysfunction, which in turn can lead to memory issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell yourself that you are going to have a lucid dream. Tell yourself that you will remember your dreams and that dreams are important to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you did have a dream and remember it, actively focus on the dream; imagine yourself in that dream and what you would have done if you had been lucid in it. Think about that dream as if you were lucid and set the intention to have a lucid dream while going back to bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wake up from the alarm: When your alarm goes off, get up and go get some water, go to the bathroom, and do some activity for forty-five to sixty minutes, or whatever you feel comfortable with. Get ready to go back to sleep: Lie down in bed and relax. Set the intention again that you are going to have a lucid dream. Go back to sleep: This part is trickier, as you may be overstimulated at this point, and sleeping may be difficult. Just relax, and think about nothing. As you adopt this new sleep routine, your mind will automatically wake you up and allow you to go back to sleep pretty often. Every hour or so, your body will go through a phase of sleep, and you will wake back up. At this point, try your best not to open your eyes or move. You should notice that you’re awake, but try to imagine seeing yourself in the mirror of your bathroom or imagine a face or object in your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>physical dream journal is perhaps the most important item in your lucid dreaming tool kit. Dream journals help keep our long-term memory active. Journaling also increases our motivation to remember dreams and increases our dream retention and recall after waking</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wake up during the night, recall their dream as it happened in their memories, and imagine what might have happened in the dream if they had been lucid. While focusing on that idea, participants would then go back to bed with the intention of having a lucid dream while simultaneously thinking about the past dream as if they had just had a lucid dream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Useful in conjunction with WBTB or WILD techniques, active imagination is a technique that draws the dream to the dreamer rather than the dreamer chasing after the dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The key principle of active imagination is to follow the images where they arise rather than trying to pursue or manipulate them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>reality itself is a simulation inside our brains. Our brains take in information using our five senses and mix all this information together in our minds—creating our impressions and beliefs about the world. Because both dreams and reality are simulated in our minds, dreams can feel just as real as reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>waking life and the dream life are closely related; one will teach you the importance of the other. Through mindfulness training in our waking life, we will see our dreams for what they are: a story. Eventually, we will see that our waking life is also a story.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>dream symbol interpretations that were objectively true for everyone. And there is merit to the idea that many symbols operate on a macro level as widely accepted cultural tropes or memes, or as part of a collective unconscious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is your own perspective on your dream images that helps you understand their meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can also communicate to the unconscious through understanding those symbols. This deep conversation is where the magic of lucid dreaming happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lucid dreaming is, at its heart, a practice of the imagination. It puts us in direct contact with the heady idea that our dreams are as real as waking life, and that waking life is as much a product of imagination as our dreams are. So in order for the whole practice to work, you have to believe the symbols will work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As you call up more and more symbols for examination, you will increase your facility in navigating your own dreams, improve your meditation practice, and likely begin to have out-of-body experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>an attempt to interpret someone else’s dream, especially that of a stranger, and without context, is a waste of time and money at best and interferes with the dreamer’s development at worst. Dream content is unique to each dreamer in specific ways that are not intended for outsiders to access or understand in the way the dreamer should.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a practice is built one step at a time with equal parts tradition and direct personal experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>first writing down and then recounting vocally every possible detail from the dream, and then repeating the dream from the beginning until it feels like a story from which we can derive some meaning. Last, recall how specific points in the dream and its content affect you emotionally. Look at the direct, overt, or more universal nature of the symbols and their emotional context in your own life. Dreams do not refer to the past—they convey messages relevant today—so the dream symbols and content should be relevant to what is currently happening or to what may be happening soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your dreams are unique. Others’ dreams are unique to them. The best person to understand a dream is the dreamer. Being honest with yourself and willing to listen to what a dream has to say is key to dream interpretation.</p>

<p>“Dreams are the space in between reality, where others’ unconsciousness can meet and interact with each other in a version of reality.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are painting a picture that’s constantly changing. No one version is the real or final version, but each iteration has something new to tell us if we are willing to listen. Investigating those new angles and versions to understand aspects of the self can guide us toward understanding who we are and reaching who we want to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell the dream once through in the present tense</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>according to Jung, while many dream images and experiences are universal, the concepts we associate with them and our emotional reactions to them can be subjective and personal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we have to expose ourselves to the animal impulse of the unconscious without identifying with it and without “running away”; for flight from the unconscious would defeat the purpose of the whole proceeding. We must hold our ground, which means here that the process initiated by the dreamer’s self-observation must be experienced in all its ramifications and then articulated with consciousness to the best of his understanding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The journey is inevitable. You are making progress. The sooner you recognize that and learn how to work with rather than against the synchronicities, symbols, and dreams all around you, the faster and further you can progress on your journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These dreams and experiences don’t need external validation; they’re there for you alone. Talking to others may provide some guidance or encouragement, but there is enough in the dreams themselves to work with. From this point, you can embark on the adventure of exploring the nature of your dream world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That awareness—that you are dreaming and so have some control over your actions and over the trajectory of the dream, and yet at the same time have to surrender to the laws of a new world—is where the learning resides.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Much like how giving up control in our own lives can be a path to happiness, it is when we’re willing to relinquish some control over our dream narratives that we become open to the wisdom of the unconscious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The passage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation. Instead of passing outward, beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born again.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Campbell wrote, “The passage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation. Instead of passing outward, beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Failing repeatedly is the way to learn and eventually move forward. Dream trials focus more intensely on the dissolution of the ego and sense of self:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Coming into contact with death and our fears of dying helps release us from the illusion of control over our lives, and in doing so we release ourselves from fear and anxiety. The courage this release brings will enable us to overcome even bigger obstacles—the Mother and Father—as we continue forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>trust the process and the self.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we are responsible for independently making difficult decisions in the dream world just as we are in waking life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the world of the unconscious is vaster and more powerful than any conscious understanding. “The unconscious is an autonomous psychic entity,” Jung wrote. “Any efforts to drill it are only apparently successful, and moreover are harmful to the consciousness.” He warns anyone trying to control the creative aspects of their minds that “we can listen but may not meddle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>truly look at the dream world, you will quickly realize that you cannot control it, just as you cannot control the waking world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So wherever we go in a dream, our unconscious mind has already been there. Because of that, the narrator or observer of the dream world knows what, where, and who we will see before we choose to manifest or move forward. The result is the illusion of control over the unconscious. But the dream is always one step ahead of us. Jung said it best in his essay “General Aspects of Dream Psychology” when he implied that we are all parts of the dream simultaneously. “This whole creation is essentially subjective, and the dream is the theater where the dreamer is at once scene, actor, prompter, stage manager, author, audience, and critic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting the intention of a willingness to transform opens the door for transformation to arrive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>dreams are here to help us find our true selves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key component of what makes this moment of pause remarkable and invaluable in life is its ability to help identify emotions from moment to moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear is powerful; there’s a reason that “Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid” is such a popular Bible verse. Humans are mammals hardwired for safety, so we are highly attuned to danger and fear. This is a primal force that lives deep within our collective and individual unconscious. Fear isn’t something that humans can simply eradicate, so it’s important—but difficult—to learn how to manage it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re all fundamentally selfish and capable of inflicting incredible damage in the right (or wrong) circumstances. To ignore those darker aspects of ourselves is like having an alternative personality hidden from everyone’s view—including our own. That shadow will inevitably demand to be seen. Again, it’s a case of let go or be dragged along.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We simply accuse our enemy of our own unadmitted faults.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in order to achieve greatness, you also need darkness. By destroying or ignoring one, you limit the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to get past the illusion of reality, you must go on the journey—past our ideas about reality, past our symbolic representations of ourselves, and into the heart of the true self.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need that skepticism for quality assurance, because fooling oneself is easy. This is why I so love the statement in Psalm 34:9, “Taste and see that God is good.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if an insight emerges for you, take a few quiet moments to daven it in. And may you, too, as so many holy ones have before, experience the vision of prayer in your mind’s eye, the living taste of prayer in your heart, and the deep and gentle glow of prayer in your soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Deuteronomy 26:17–18, which speak of a reciprocal relationship between us and God. The verb used to capture this relationship is aleph-mem-resh. In the simple form this means “to say,” but here—uniquely in Torah—it is used in a transitive form: he’emarta and he’emirkha. God “says” us, and we “say” God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as I heard it said to me in a whisper, so I told it to you in a whisper” (Genesis Rabbah 3:4).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The imaginal world is a real world. Real things happen in the imaginal world that affect this world in turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>prayer begins with kavanah. To daven with kavanah means to pray with focus, intention, meaning. It means praying from the heart, rather than prayer centered solely in the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kavanah is not attained in a day. We start small and build patiently on every small success. But if we aim our actions and our davening toward a godly place, we will get there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I can’t do this without Your help.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dear God, please help me to let this thought go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>), wisdom to yield ko’ach mah (), the power of “What?”—the wisdom of getting to know what a thing is. Wise Mind seeks to understand the mitzvah lifnai ve-lifnim, inside and out. He wants to do the mitzvah in a completely integrated and organic way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“duties of the heart,” in Bachya ibn Pakuda’s famous phrase,3 cannot be fulfilled without conscious and deliberate intention.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Saying the words without intent is clearly unsatisfactory; on the other hand, saying every word and syllable with full and true kavanah is close to impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My entire life and everything I do are nothing but God Godding Godself as Zalman. The best thing I can do, then, is to make my life a good ride for God, to consciously devote my actions to that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The awareness that we stand in the presence of the Living God is one of the most important realizations we can install in our operative consciousness. God is always present. The question is, how present are we? We want to stand in that Presence without opacity. Our work is to penetrate, in meditation and in action, to the very heart of being nokhach penei ha-Shem (Lamentations 2:19), of being truly present before God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Meister Eckhart was trying to express when he wrote, “The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees me. My eye and God’s eye are one eye, one sight, one knowledge, and one love.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>meditating on the Tetragrammaton, the letters of God’s mysterious name, can open a channel to bring down the holy. As in Vipassana or pranayama, we can use our breathing to help us get there. Your lungs without breath are like the yud, the smallest letter, the vanishing point. Our inhalation forms the hey, letter of breath: hhhhhhh. At the top of the breath we form the vav, straight as an erect backbone. Then we breathe out—hhhhhhh—another hey. So we invite YHVH to come down and dwell within us. As Jews we are concerned about living in this world. Ours is not primarily an Ein Sof focus, a preoccupation with the world beyond the beyond, but a Gaia focus. Our fundamental kavanah is not to leave the world behind but to bring God into this world, to create the “Kingdom of heaven” in the life we live, right here and now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yir’ah, awe, is sometimes translated as fear, but neither completely captures the idea. The Hebrew root of yir’ah is yud-resh-aleph . The root of words meaning sight or to see is resh-aleph-hey . Yir’ah arises from the state of being seen for what we really are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The awareness that we are being seen, that we do everything we do in the presence of that Witness—that is the true path to and meaning of yir’ah.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The disciple says, “Master, I couldn’t find a place where no One can see me.” The awareness that we are being seen, that we do everything we do in the presence of that Witness—that is the true path to and meaning of yir’ah.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I ascend to heaven, there You are; if I make my bed in hell, You are there” (Psalm 139:8).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>important forms of consciousness maintenance, of kavanah watching kavanah.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I knew it, I would be it; if I were it, I would know it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>le-khaven el ha-matarah, to aim at the bull’s-eye. (Le-khaven is from the same root as kavanah, kaf-vav-nun.) This is a useful metaphor. When I finally embrace a matarah—a bull’s-eye, a target for my existence—and I say, “Yes, I will go with that, I will collaborate with that, I will invest myself in that,” then my embracing becomes a kavanah.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>olam ha-ba—not “the world to come,” as the phrase is usually translated, but a world that is, at this very moment, becoming in us and around us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I come with a scroll-book on me,” says the psalmist, “in which there is one thing written”—like a journal, in which you declare its purpose on page one. This is what the scroll says: “My only desire is to do Your will. I want Your teaching in my very kishkes” (Psalm 40:8–9). This is my intent. This is what I want to do. I’m not there yet, but I’m on my way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of kavanah lies the question: Why? Hebrew has two different words for why, madu’a and lamah, and each has a slightly different emphasis. Madu’a asks, “Mah yadu’a? What is known to us?” Philosophers might call this the what of etiology. It wants to know about origins and causes. Lamah asks, “Le-mah? What for?” This is the why of teleology. It asks: Where are we going with this? What is the goal? The why at the heart of kavanah is not only the madu’a of origins but the lamah of ultimate purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every locksmith has a master key with which he can open many doors. Neginah is such a key, for it can unlock all doors.” Why? Because a niggun sung in the proper way is like doing teshuvah, like a moment of true repentance and turning to God. The wellsprings of niggun and teshuvah are the simple yearnings of the heart that we all share.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The word nusach can mean both text and melody.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nusach can also mean the melody or musical mode of a given time and place, which is what I mean here. Nusach conveys information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nusach also conveys emotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ga’agu’im or longing niggunim that raise up these unspoken questions can create a sacred space that all can share.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the heart wants to daven, and the mind starts arguing. But, as the great cantor and educator Max Helfman said once, “you can’t argue with a song or a dance!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe “the work is not upon you to finish” (Pirkei Avot 2:21). Someone else may complete your tune someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with the emotions that you hear behind the words.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>emotional landscapes—sometimes within a single paragraph.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A niggun is a path to God, a “song of ascension.” But we must set out along that path! We must travel with that intention in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>True prayer is like the iceberg: little that is visible on the surface, much that happens below.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the invitation to prayer says “come as you are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>our souls accept only one outcome when it comes to prayer: transformation. We do not wish just to spin our mental wheels: We want to be changed. We want to be moved. We want to end in a better place than where we started. Our souls yearn for this. If we really mean the words we say, how can we help but be moved?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>prayers as a journey through four different landscapes, four distinct facets of human experience: physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. Each facet has its own character; each communicates in its own language; each speaks to a different part of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Asiyah is the realm of the practical and the sensible—the stuff we apprehend with our senses. We’re packing for our spiritual journey here, grounding ourselves in our physical bodies and in the here and now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yetzirah, on a human level, is the world of feelings, the world of passion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The language here is plural. In Yetzirah, the realm of emotions and love, the boundaries between ourselves and others begin to feel permeable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m attracted to you in Asiyah! I love you in Yetzirah!” She’s saying, “Meet me in Beriyah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Beriyah, the language is no longer immanent but transcendent. Beriyah is the place of Wow, the place of wonder. We praise and give thanks for the constant and miraculous regeneration by a Creator who “renews, each day and always, the work of creation.” This is not the big bang understanding, in which a single event set the rest of the universe in motion. It is a mystical vision of the entire world being created anew in every instant. A person who sees the universe with such eyes can welcome each and every moment as a new opportunity for praise. In Beriyah, we are still in the group, but what the group does at this stage is to give you a matrix in which to do your individual work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An important part of davening is to just sit be-nachat ru’ach, in serenity of spirit, and to allow for that to come in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The word Atzilut refers to something that is noble, high, beyond. The world of Atzilut transcends our level of understanding. Boundaries are gone, definitions are gone. Individual words and thoughts are gone. We ourselves do not exist. Being as we know it has ceased.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kabbalistic tradition imagines us davening the Amidah in the world of Atzilut.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So never mind the achievements and attainments; just talk like a friend to God about what you are really concerned about. If a thought comes, turn it into a prayer. These heartfelt prayers are the ones that are really important; these are the prayers we save for Atzilut, sending them directly to the highest level. I start by saying the introductory verse: “Adonai sefatai tiftach u-fi yagid tehilatekha, Please God, open my lips and let my mouth declare Your praise.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a concern comes up for anything, turn it into a bakashah, a request. Then set is aside and go back to stillness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each dimension of ourselves—physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual—has its own needs and speaks its own language. I don’t want to leave any part of me out. I want my davening, my spiritual life and practice, to integrate them all. How can this holy conversation be real unless my entire self is engaged?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot think our way to God. We cannot reach God by a safe, step-by-step process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we limit God to the ultimate abstraction, then whom are we praying to? But if instead we come at this from a Yetzirah heart space, that changes everything. If we attune ourselves to Yetzirah, the language of the davening makes sense, and all the stuff that we’re talking about here make sense. The feeling that we’re “doing the divine thing” makes sense—that’s why I like the term davening best, to describe what we’re doing at prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where in this many-layered universe does compassion reside? Who is the You of God for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All we need are feelings that we want to share with the listening presence of the universe. If you are not yet used to praying, start by expressing yourself in your own words.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>how much time they had. I got some flak</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Voice arouses kavanah,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Daven so your heart can feel what your lips are saying!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every breath will praise Yah” (Psalm 150:6). We can use this as a meditation with the YHVH, the Tetragrammaton. First empty your lungs and contemplate the yud, the smallest Hebrew letter, closest to emptiness. Then you breathe in, making a hhhhh sound; that’s the first hey. You hold the breath for a moment, sending it to all six directions in your body—that’s the vav, the sixth letter of the alphabet. Then you breathe out, hhhhh, to make the other hey. So we can use this prayer to scan our lung capacity and check in with our breath.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Barukh ha-Shem—thank God. At last! Now I am free just to sit and enjoy. I don’t need to run; I don’t need to make, do, fix, or change. For one day, I can just be.” If we pause from running through our day to offer a prayer, we find that we have created a little piece of Shabbos</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the centuries, the payyetanim—Jewish writers of spiritual poetry (piyyut, piyyutim)—have sought new ways of declaring their love for God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ashkenazi siddurim have “Ahavah rabbah ahavtanu” in the morning prayers and “Ahavat olam beit Yisrael amkha ahavtah” in the evening prayer. Chabad and some of the Sepharad siddurim, however, follow the Ari, who saw an important kavanah in the first letters of ahavat olam ahavtanu: aleph (1) + ayin (70) + aleph (1) add up to 72, a number the kabbalists saw as a permutation of YHVH: yud = 10; yud hey = 15; yud hey vav = 21; yud hey vav hey = 26. And 10 + 15 + 21 + 26 = 72.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we study Torah, may we see clearly what is meant for us to know. When we do Mitzvot, may all our feelings sit harmonious in our heart. Focus all our hearts’ longing on that moment, when we stand in Your Presence, in awe and adoration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>harder to grasp than it sounds. The Tikkunei Zohar marvels, “You are One, but not in the sense of enumeration”—not “one” as an alternative to two, three, or four, but a Unity of infinite existence and infinite potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>asking for what we truly need is the hardest part of prayer. We throw up all sorts of obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whom am I praying to? I am praying to God, however I understand and experience that word right here and right now. I may not be praying to the God that is All, but simply sharing my tsuris with the face of God with which I am most intimate. Perhaps I am praying to whatever it is that listens in the universe. I don’t need to do any more than that. Who am I to ask for anything? I am a creation and manifestation of godliness. I am a wave in the ocean and a world unto myself. The infinite potential for creativity and love in the universe manifests in me and through me, as it does in every other creature. And will it help? We know some parents pray with all their hearts for a child to be cured of a life-threatening disease, and yet the little one dies. We pray daily for peace, yet we are still at war. Prayer is not a switch with which we can control the universe. But I do believe that we can, with our prayers, reach dimensions of existence that we do not otherwise have access to and that the openings in those higher worlds bring blessings down to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A prayer truly prayed is the beginnings of its own answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“O God, open up my lips, and let my mouth speak Your praise.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This first sentence reminds us that prayer begins with silence. Think back to the silence that follows the last, enlarged dalet of the Shema statement’s final ECHAD. This is not a silence of absence but a silence full of the presence of the One, a silence of infinite potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we want our prayers to be answered, we have to make sure not to hang up the phone too quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During the week, you can take a piece of notepaper and a pencil. Reflect for a few moments after your davening and see what comes down. “So what do I have to do today, Ribbono shel olam?” Write down what comes to you, and try to refer to it during the day or before you go to sleep at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I begin in Asiyah, putting on my tallis and tefillin first, creating the prayer space that I need. I check in with my body, and I say Asher Yatzar, acknowledging the miracle of the limbs and organs that sustain me. Then I look out of the window and see the world outside, the people and the buildings and the trees, the sun or the rain or the snow, and I say, “Thank You, Ribbono shel olam, all of these are wonderful, and I thank You.” I want to spend a little time in Yetzirah if I possibly can, giving my emotions a voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that without help I’m not going to make it. I close with the Amidah’s final thought: “Oseh shalom, just as in the heavens everything works out as it should, so please, bring peace and tranquility upon us as well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the first task before us is to empty ourselves of our expectations—to free ourselves of the hold they have over us. I always quote Swami Satchidananda, who would say, “Don’t make any appointments, you won’t have any dis-appointments!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dear God, whatever jealousies and resentments I might harbor in my heart, please remove this judgment from me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reb Pinchas of Koretz, the great Hasidic master, wondered how we can pray for other people to become better. Are we not depriving that person of their choice and free will? The answer, he says, is that we are all part of each other. You are in me, and I am in you. Praying for the “you in me” to be better—the “you” that resides in my heart—somehow helps the “me in you” to do something good for you, and the “you in you” to become better. This is not a moral vision but an organismic vision. On a prayerful level, we are all part of each other and of the greater whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I am not for myself, who will be? But if I am only for myself, what am I?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>aleph-mem-nun, meaning to be firm or trustworthy. Amen means “So be it. May your words come to pass.” It is prayer and affirmation in one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jakobson, Jespersen, Bloomfield, Sapir, Firth – have written beautifully insightful articles on the relationship between sound and meaning, it has never reached the mainstream, and as far as I know, only Keith McCune and Amanuma have gone through all the major sound facts in any language.1 This very marginal field is called sound symbolism (though I prefer to call it phonosemantics, because I find the word ‘symbolism’ confusing).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each word has an aspect of meaning which lies deeper than any of its senses, and it is fundamentally on this meaning that all the senses depend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That problem arises because we are posing a question on the wrong level of abstraction – a question which therefore is meaningless.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential nature of a symbol is that it is first of all itself, and only secondarily is it its function.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With the word as the mechanism of creation, everything that did not yet exist was named and all appeared.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Velar phonemes pronounced at the back of the mouth (/g/, /k/, /h/, /G/) are generally receptive. Labial phonemes pronounced at the lips (/b/, /p/, /v/, /f/, /m/, /w/) are rarely receptive and are often directed outward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Socrates’ Hypothesis 1. That each phoneme has a meaning which it passes on to every word that contains it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In truth language does not reside in man but man stands in language and speaks out of it.” We wander the earth, as the instruments of these peculiar sound beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I too am a true believer in the autonomy of the archetype. A /t/ or an /h/ is no less than a Zeus. The consonants are not essentially physical, but they live, evolve and influence human affairs. We overlook something essential if we deny that they can get up and walk around. This is not to say that their existence is independent of the human psyche. But then everything depends on everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are, so to speak, blinded to content by form. Reference does this by taking a possible context for a word very seriously, and freezing the word within a specific context into a ‘thing’ unto itself. It makes static what was fluid by limiting it to a context and claiming it to be a different thing in this context than in the next. The transition from process to thing is part and parcel to limitation within context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tao of Physics</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are correct about the usefulness of drawing the distinction between inherent and referential semantics, then the mouth can be viewed as a system whose physics in part determines the meanings of words. Imagine that each phoneme has inherent physical properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>deduce the very general physical properties of the phonemes by how they interact in words, and this may or may not prove to correlate with muscle tension, air pressure in the mouth, etc. during articulation. Unfortunately there is probably no very reliable way to measure this muscle tension or air pressure. If there were a real physiological basis to this ‘wild idea’, one could imagine using word semantics to make educated guesses about muscle tension. This in turn could perhaps be used to make predictions about syllable structure and other phonological processes, as well as word semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When an idea gets repeated often enough, it becomes common knowledge. When it becomes really convincing, then it starts sinking deeper and deeper into the unconscious recesses of the language. The sound meanings we are discussing and also metaphors are examples of this subconscious language - this background of invisible assumptions that we all share as speakers of English. The history of human thought lies buried in the phoneme meanings and other unconscious aspects of language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Emerson says that the corruption of man is followed by the corruption of language.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mystic must first be an extremely good scientist, for science is the starting point and prerequisite of all higher endeavors. It is the discipline of stating truthfully and non-judgmentally what was observed – no more and no less.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mystical and scientific thought systems are reconciled in the realization that mind gives rise to matter, and not the other way around. The material universe is a thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Language, as it turns out, is not dead, but a living being on whose health all of us depend. The fact that each consonant is an archetype is significant not because of what it can be used for, but because when one meets each god face to face, one cannot but realize that it is conscious, present, and alive. It looks upon the child who wanders into its dominion with a steady eye, and tolerates her only as long as her intentions are pure. One leaves with no doubt that this force, though patient, is silently recording every thought, and will have its way in the end. We may as well deal with the gods now, face to face, rather than be forced to eat our own garbage at some future period of time. There is linguistic ecology just as surely as there is planetary ecology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All that matters is the act of speaking itself, the manner in which my relationship with him plays itself out. I dance with English, and our tale is only just beginning. Everything depends on my recognition of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as children busy in our happy task, and with the door left ajar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One final thought: When you give people a choice of product or service tiers, you do something subtle but powerful. You shift the internal question for the customer from, “Should I buy this?” to “Which one should I buy?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it should be added that in this realm of appearances maya does have its own reality. Everything is a dream, but even dreams, as dreams, are real.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-realization and the knowledge of God, are synonymous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the truths propounded in the Gita are applicable at all levels of life: material, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Paramhansa Yogananda makes the point that every great scripture is multi-leveled, addressing the vast variety of human needs from a standpoint of divine wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there are several paths to God, according, not to people’s beliefs, but to each person’s own temperament. He delineates the right attitudes for the devotee, the various delusions that can prevent him from finding God, and the way to overcome them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A true scripture, Paramhansa Yogananda stated, addresses human needs in their entirety.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>three nadis, or subtle channels of life force, called</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the spiritual eye, one may ask, merely symbolic? No, it is actually beheld, and is, in fact, a reflection of the light in the medulla, through which the energy moves down the spine in three nadis, or subtle channels of life force, called the sushumna, the vajra, and the chitra.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Circumstances,” Paramhansa Yogananda commented, “are always neutral. They appear positive or negative according to the corresponding reactions of the heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every act, every thought, has its specific consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This means we should not depend on our good habits alone to see us through psychological and spiritual tests. Habit born of past actions may give us good karma, but karma itself must be transcended in dedication to the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when you succeed in converting enough mental citizens to the side of goodness, they will outnumber the unruly ones and will gradually win them over, resulting in your rapid spiritual progress.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We must transform our faults into virtues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every human trait begins as a simple thought. There is nothing man can achieve or even conceive that, as an idea, is inaccessible to any other human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The part played by the guru is not to make his disciples over in his own image, but, by sharing his magnetism with them, to uplift their consciousness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How is one to know what course in life is right or wrong? The first rule is, “Do what works.” That is why the question, “What was the outcome?” is more important than, “What are they doing?” Only from the outcome of a course of action can it be known with any certainty whether the act was justified or not. The maxim, “The end justifies the means,” is true only as long as the end is visualized in theory, in advance. Once it has been actually reached, however, it will show whether the means to it were right or not. Wrong means to an imaginary good end will produce, at last, disharmony and failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Judge your thoughts and actions by their effects—on yourself, first; then on others. Are they peace-inducing? Are they as universally beneficial as possible? Do they help to expand your understanding and sympathies? Have they brought greater harmony to your environment?—or have they produced disharmony? Do they inspire you and others? or have they brought less hope generally—even despair?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One should not wish harm to anything, but one may be obliged to kill harmful creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Arjuna, nothing is ever lost. What you relinquish on the material plane you will rediscover a thousand times more wonderfully in God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sensations such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain are generated through the senses in (their) contact with the world. They are ideas only: transitory, each with its beginning and end. O Descendent of Bharata, bear with them patiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one who is calm and even-minded, never ruffled during pain and pleasure: he alone gains consciousness of his eternal existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why lament that which cannot be avoided?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>stoicism</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One needs to know why it is necessary to seek truth, how best to go about it, and what one may expect (stated with as much intellectual clarity as possible, though emphasizing that direct experience alone conveys true understanding).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Renunciation of the world in thought as well as in deed is essential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mind itself is the battlefield. There is no other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true Self can be sustained only by spiritual states of consciousness, such as divine love, calmness, and bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether they are greeted with pleasure or distaste depends entirely on one’s mental conditioning. The human mind, unlike the minds of lower animals, can train itself to like anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“as if smiling.” This phrase, Yogananda said, is important, because it indicates that God is no stern judge of human behavior, but is “on our side.” He wants us to advance spiritually, and forever forgives us if we err.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be “even-minded and cheerful” under all circumstances is the first duty of the yogi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>even-mindedly toward his goal by performing ever calmly his karmically assigned duties. To be “even-minded and cheerful” under all circumstances is the first duty of the yogi. This</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be “even-minded and cheerful” under all circumstances is the first duty of the yogi. This obviously does not mean being cheerful about other people’s suffering! One must respect, and even empathize with, their pains—as Krishna did. As regards one’s own pains, however, the aspiring yogi must firmly banish all thought of ego-identification with both pleasure and pain. Pain may in fact be “happening,” but he must not think of it as his own. The more he can resist the oppositional states of Nature—maya’s dualities (dwaita)—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good practice for the devotee is deliberately to submit himself to extreme opposites: heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc. He should be careful not to test his powers too far beyond their proven ability so far. To do so would be fanaticism. Indeed, it might prove counter-productive: One could stand too long under a cold shower, and find himself hardly feeling warm again for months! One could even endanger his health. Along with the counsel to be even-minded and cheerful is an equally important one: Use common sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For even-mindedness, an important practice is to give up likes and dislikes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing belongs to you—not even your own ego! Firmly to hold this attitude is the way to inner freedom</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the refusal to act is a kind of activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the ego? Imagine the moon reflected in many vessels of water. Each vessel contains the same reflection, yet the reflection seems, in each of them, to be individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision not to act is like restraining a horse by the reins: It takes an effort of will, and therefore implies an act of some kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>spiritual progress consists not in actually achieving anything, but in simply removing the distortions that obscure the nature of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter Eleven</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this yoga there is only that one direction (with no polar opposite).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the sincere spiritual aspirant, little could seem more like hell than to be stuck for all eternity in an ego, even if the body in which one lives is forever healthy, supple, youthful, and full of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Heaven is usually offered as bait: a place where people spend eternity in a beautiful, idyllic environment of great natural beauty, surrounded by “angels.” To the sincere spiritual aspirant, little could seem more like hell than to be stuck for all eternity in an ego, even if the body in which one lives is forever healthy, supple, youthful, and full of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“center everywhere, circumference nowhere,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>only Hinduism (and I say this as one who was, himself, raised in orthodox Christianity) formally teaches moksha, or liberation from the very ego, in union with the Omnipresent, Divine Consciousness. Jesus Christ taught it. Few however, if any, of his self-declared followers believe that when he spoke of heaven he was referring to that same state of moksha: complete liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>most religious teachers offer a compromise of lower spiritual truths, they betray their own religion. Paramhansa Yogananda used to say, “Jesus Christ was crucified once, but his teachings have been crucified every day, throughout Christendom, since that time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If only Hinduism declares this highest spiritual truth, surely it is because only Hinduism has not been confined in the “straitjacket” of a religious organization! It has grown naturally, rather, and has not been suffocated in the musty air of official decrees regarding what is, and what is not, the highest truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>its attachment to the results of action. Those results, because of that attachment, must return to their source.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pray in this way: ‘I will reason, I will will, I will act, but guide Thou my reason, will, and activity to the right path in everything.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to this achievement is to remain ever calm in the Self, free from any thought of either acceptance or possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pride goes before a fall.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scripture itself is no substitute for self-effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>well when the land all around is in flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the Vedas are of no more use than a well when the land all around is in flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the knower of Brahman (the Supreme Spirit) the Vedas are of no more use than a well when the land all around is in flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wanting some sort of ego-payment for favors rendered. The Lord is no merchant</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who seek lesser favors from God are asking for a teaspoon of soil when they might have the whole kingdom. The problem in people’s minds is, of course, that they think to possess.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To attain God-consciousness, it is necessary to release all attachment to thoughts of “I” and “mine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people—many hermits, for example—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect evenness of mind and feeling is itself the definition of yoga.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Affirmations of calmness in the midst of stress often have the contrary effect of creating more tension! In any case, calmness can be affirmed effectively only with inner calmness. Such calmness can hardly be established without also stilling the thoughts in meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One can run nervously,” the Master replied, “or one can run calmly, but not to run when one needs to is to be lazy!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pranayama is a condition, not a technique.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>withdrawal of the energy is the true meaning of pranayama: “yama (control) of the prana (energy).” Pranayama is a condition, not a technique. The practice of pranayama is to achieve energy control.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Breathlessness is deathlessness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is helpful, when trying to develop emotional detachment, to concentrate one’s energy in the spine,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two requirements, above all, for the attainment of wisdom. One, to withdraw the mind not only from sense objects, but from the senses themselves; and, two, to remain merged in the consciousness of God as the most desirable of all goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>suffering diminishes when there is a decrease of self-interest. The discernment of this truth leads to the first faint stirrings of recollection that a reality exists that is more than the ego and the body. The fog of delusion begins to lift from the mind, and one no longer strikes out at the world in anger for not giving him what he wants. From acceptance of what is comes a gradual decrease of worldly attachment. From lessened attachment comes lessening interest in the objects of the senses, and an increase of longing for true wisdom—a longing which awakens devotion in the heart, love of truth, and intense aspiration to know true and everlasting bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mistakes on the path are always possible. The devotee should acknowledge them sincerely and openly (at least to himself), and then simply forsake them. He should avoid the further mistake of becoming upset with himself. He should keep his mind focused steadfastly on the polestar of his true goal: union with God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the ego is a delusion, anything that tempts it to affirm its own separate reality is a delusion also. And so too, indeed, is any distress one may feel with oneself for having succumbed to delusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you feel pleasure, let it remind you of soul-bliss. Whenever you see beauty, take into yourself the joy you feel in it. Let every worldly happiness remind you of the much greater happiness of the Self. Some yogis recommend complete indifference to the world. What a dry outlook! Far better is it, my Guru taught, to enjoy with God the beauties and the pure delights of this world, by focusing on the inner joy you feel during experiences that uplift the heart’s feelings</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Spiritual progress is achieved not by the tense effort demanded for material success, but rather by a process of upward relaxation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the key to right meditation is relaxation—physically, emotionally, and mentally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>High truths cannot be learned: they can only be remembered in the Self.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>doing harm to others never succeeded in bringing him happiness;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All who would unite their souls with God must follow that same path: yama and niyama (right action); asana (firmness of posture, and keeping the spine straight to enable the energy to flow freely through it); pranayama (control over the energy of the body); pratyahara (interiorization of the mind); dharana (one-pointed concentration); dhyana (absorption in deep meditation); and samadhi (oneness).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Actionlessness cannot be attained by mere inaction. One who forsakes work (in the name of divine aloofness from activity) cannot reach perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My Guru explained that a liberated master, whatever his role on earth, never loses his inner awareness of freedom</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can they cease from breathing by merely not breathing? Can they refrain from thinking by merely not thinking? Can they achieve silence by merely not speaking? One wonders how any aspirant to wisdom can conceive such absurdities! All creation exists in a vibratory state. The very atoms are constantly in movement. Prakriti (Nature) forces man to be active. Anyone who tries to be inactive becomes merely lazy. Anyone who pretends to be disinvolved in the world around him is being merely hypocritical. In order to achieve the actionless state it is utterly necessary to act consciously—not merely driven by Nature, but deliberately and intelligently, like a surfer going with the waves of circumstance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>any show of religiosity is acceptable only according to the depth of inner sincerity involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wish to impress indicates a desire for results, rather than true sincerity of feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The greater the will, the greater the flow of energy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No activity engaged in merely to impress others (or even God) will, in the end, bear divine fruit. Spiritual progress is achieved above all by desiring it intensely, and not by inflicting violent discipline on the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform those actions which your duty dictates, for action is better than inaction. Without action, in-deed, even the act of maintaining life in the body would not be possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is often best to undertake first those battles which one can be more confident of winning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One moment,” the saying goes, “in the company of a saint can be your raft over the ocean of delusion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Very few human beings are ready for the highest spiritual blessing: the help of a true guru.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The work before him of achieving infinity is colossal! If he has any wisdom at all, he must surely see that he needs all the help he can get!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Life must be continuously progressive. If it tries to remain stationary, it is already living death. There are devas, or angels, to whom we can appeal, or with whose energies we can work in cooperation. As with other human beings, we gain much more by giving to them than by trying to snatch our gain from them. Even in the ashrams of great gurus, those disciples receive the most spiritually who, by their appreciation, give energy and don’t try to draw God’s blessings self-centeredly to themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The age we now live in is an upward-moving age (not Kali Yuga, as people generally believe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All things exist in a state of vibration. That is how the Supreme, ever-unmoving Spirit brought about the appearance of a reality separate from itself. As the blades of a fan, rotating rapidly, give the appearance of a solid circular disk, so Cosmic Vibration, in its infinite number of intensely rapid vibrations, gives the appearance of substance, variety, even of solidity. Thus we have, for example, the rocks, which to our senses appear very solid but which are now known to be only vibrations of energy, and which, even as material substance, are composed largely of space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without images, people’s devotion becomes dry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>feel that the energy which enables him to move and breathe is not his own, personally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To gorge one’s food gluttonously is to feed not only the body but the ego.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vibration is action, which is to say, karma.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AUM is properly written with three letters. The first letter signifies Brahma; the second one, Vishnu; and the third (properly pronounced as a slightly drawn-out hum), Shiva.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AUM samadhi. His next perception is of Kutastha Chaitanya, or Tat, the Christ consciousness behind the vibrations of his body—and the center of every vibration of the body, reflecting the motionless Spirit beyond creation. Gradually his consciousness expands with the Christ consciousness, or Tat, until he perceives it as infinite. It is after reaching that stage, my Guru explained to me, that one may be called a master.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suffering comes primarily from the thought,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more things change, the more they remain unchanged.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What needs changing is no social system, but human consciousness. The best way to change society, surely, would be to create little societies that can inspire others to make the recommended changes, individually, in themselves, rather than forcing everyone to march in lock-step togetherness toward some general “good” that often ends in disaster. If an example works, others may be inspired by it, and may want to change. Without the desire to change, no one will ever do better at anything. The first responsibility the universe places on every person’s shoulders is this: “Change yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yet still I work on for the upliftment of others. There, where all uplifting work is done, am I.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never should the wise condemn the ignorant for the ego-motivation they manifest. Instead, being themselves enlightened, they should seek only to inspire others in the direction of preferring to perform right, dutiful action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as foolish people, out of attachment to ego, act in hope of rewards, so should the wise also (even if wisdom has lifted them out of any personal need to be active), act with dispassion and non-attachment, glad to be of service to others as their guides</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To drive a dark mood out of the mind, for example, try this simple method: Focus your energy and attention strongly at the point between the eyebrows. The magnetism you generate there will lift you out of the fogs of gloom to a higher, more spiritual atmosphere where peace, joy, and complete acceptance reign.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He should not, however, allow anything to disturb his inner peace. Even if he sees wrong in the world, and accepts it as a manifestation of maya, he can remain inwardly undisturbed by it, and can work impersonally to improve matters in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Work with what is, not with what you think should be.” All human suffering is due to the simple thought that things ought to be other than they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t let others tell you what you, in their eyes, ought to be. On the other hand, never dismiss their advice arrogantly. Try at the same time, rather, to be always true to your own nature. You will never change yourself by suppression. Real change comes only by transcendence. If there is some quality in yourself that you don’t like, try to lift your awareness to a higher level.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never let yourself become infatuated (infatuation is extreme attraction) with anything or anyone. Never let yourself hate anything or anyone. Develop an attitude, rather, of accepting the cosmic dream as it is, even when it becomes a nightmare!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“People are so skillful in their ignorance!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Time must simply pass, as nature takes its course, and brings that person gradually to the point where, after repeated disappointments and the slight glimmering of hope for greater understanding, the inner person finally emerges in the full dignity of a refined human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Desire is the sinful destroyer of wisdom and of Self-realization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The senses are declared to be superior to the body (since they convey perception); the mind is superior to the senses (both inner and outer, since it is the perceiver); the discriminating intellect is superior to the mind (since it understands what it perceives); and the Self is superior to the discriminating intellect (since it is both perception and understanding).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is difficult for man to perceive that every state of consciousness already contains its opposite: that, in happiness, suffering is already present; and that (fortunately) suffering already contains at its center the seeds of joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God is Infinite Consciousness. Only Kali Yuga consciousness could have visualized Him as uniquely possessing a human form—as people believed the Earth was the center of everything, and still believed as late as the end of the nineteenth century that our sun was the center. Once every soul encased in an ego prison realizes itself as the Infinite, and no longer one little “sliver of glass” individually reflecting the cosmic light, it becomes the Infinite—God Himself. There is no difference, in essence, between Krishna, Jesus Christ, Buddha, or any other great master. There is no difference—again, in essence—between them and the rest of us, once we realize ourselves as the one God who, for a time, thought himself encased in these human egos. Everything is God. In God, all comparisons and relativities cease. The soul of Everyman was never born; nor did it ever die. In Vedantic truth there was always only one reality, one Spirit: the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>The yogi sees the body not as his body, but only as something he uses. He understands that his mind is not his own: It, too, is something he works through. He perceives the intellect as separate from his true, inner perception. And he cognizes the senses as cooperating with him, but independently from him.

He knows it is not his self, except in the sense that he, the infinite Self, must keep that little unit of reality going.</p>

<p>“Habits,” Yogananda used to say, “can be changed in a day. They are simply the result of concentrated energy. Direct that energy in a new way, and the habit you want to overcome can be instantly dispelled.” The breath, when accompanied by strong mental affirmation, is the best medium for bringing into one’s nature the thoughts and qualities one wants, and for ridding oneself of those which one wants to dismiss. In this case, too, each exhaling breath can be a little death (of the discarded quality, anyway), and each inhalation can be a little rebirth into some new quality one desires to adopt.</p>

<p>“Don’t think you can love God purely and entirely if you are able to treat even one human being unkindly. The one Lord is equally present in all. To mistreat or even to feel ill will toward any of His creatures is, at least to that extent, to separate yourself from God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many spiritually inclined people feel fulfillment in the vicarious knowledge they get from reading and discussing spiritual truths. Intellectual knowledge, however, does not touch a person inwardly. It is not based on direct experience, but only on the thoughts, opinions, and experiences of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If one learns, by such action, to see and appreciate that others, too, have their needs, then even selfish activity can lead upward, toward a freer consciousness. But if one determinedly excludes the needs of others from one’s own struggle for self-fulfillment, his consciousness will shrink inward upon itself, and his energy will move downward in the spine into the lower chakras.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A seed cannot suddenly become a tree. Every human being needs to grow from that stage which he has reached so far. Instead of expecting overnight perfection on the spiritual path, one must work realistically with the tools he has to hand. The seed will grow if it is watered regularly. That watering process, for a devotee, is daily meditation and constant practice of the presence of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The veil cast by maya, however, is heavy. Even masters must make a conscious effort to cast off its last lingering traces in their consciousness. When death comes to you, therefore, make a serious effort to sever the cords of attachment that bind you to this life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>jivan muktas—freed, that is to say, while still living in the body—even if their freedom comes only at the moment of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The less you allow your ego to identify itself with any quality, the more you’ll be able to pick and choose the qualities you’d like to manifest, and will thus learn to act appropriately under all circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, if you become satisfied with yourself, you’ll only fall—once more!—because you’ll have reaffirmed your ego.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have the faith required to follow him implicitly. True faith in the guru is not passive, nor is it an indication of ignorance. Disciples blessed with that faith soon emerge from the confines of ego into the spotless skies of divine consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a true guru makes every effort to ensure that his disciple’s obedience will be both deliberate (free-willed) and intelligent, and will not be a matter of blind or merely submissive acquiescence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The soul, as has been explained before, is encased in three such bodies, the subtlest, or causal, being the innermost, the one enclosing that (the astral body) coming next, and the outermost sheath being the physical.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There cannot be consciousness without feeling. Indeed, feeling is consciousness. Spiritual progress depends on refining the receptivity of feeling. This is possible only when the intuition is calm and, therefore, pure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Accept nothing that doesn’t appeal to your highest sense of what is right and true. Even then, be guided by the supportive opinions of the wise. When wise persons in general agree on the spiritual authenticity of a document, then only—so wisdom dictates—may the document be safely accepted as true scripture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once one has removed his ego’s natural impulse to wrest what it wants from life, he achieves his goals effortlessly, often with willing help from others.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only when we face reality as it is can we begin to change it to what it should be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>action without personal desire for the fruits of action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When others are agitated (and you might be, too), tell yourself, “Things will be normal again in a few hours, or days, or another week—or another month—or another year.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When others are agitated (and you might be, too), tell yourself, “Things will be normal again in a few hours, or days, or another week—or another month—or another year.” However long the period, it will end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>accepting whatever is as, simply, what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For much that passes for success in worldly eyes is not really even good karma, and may actually result in a person’s eventual spiritual downfall and long-range misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One is the fact that success comes as a result of focused concentration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“As long as you make the effort, God will never let you down.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Arjuna, know this for a certainty: My devotee is never lost.” One further thought remains, both to stiffen one’s resolution and to brighten one’s hope: Once the desire for God awakens in the heart, that desire must be fulfilled. It is already his guarantee of salvation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The very fact that desires can lead to anger should be a sufficient indication that the desires themselves are manifestations of bondage, not of freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fight dispassionately, without attachment to the results. This is the secret of true ahimsa, non-violence (harmlessness). Sometimes one must destroy in order to honor his higher duty. He need not, however, wish destruction on anything or anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the effect of prayer depends not on any prayer-formula, however valid in itself, but on the attitude of the person praying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each one’s faith depends upon his nature. As a man is, so is his faith. As his faith is, so is the man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are, in other words, what we believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the vibrations of what one eats. For this reason also, it is important that food be prepared in an uplifted frame of mind, and not under the influence of such harmful emotions as anger, grief, deep worry, or depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the food one eats has an effect on mental clarity and upliftment, it plays an important role not only in one’s bodily health but also in one’s spiritual life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This threefold austerity (of body, speech, and mind) is sattwic in nature; it is practiced by persevering seekers (blessed with) deep devotion, who desire not the fruits of their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My Guru used to say that to give food or money to someone in need is good; to give him a job is better; and to help him to become qualified to get a good job is best of all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On a mental plane, to give good advice inappropriately, to someone who is not likely to benefit from it, would be a mistake also. Give counsel charily, when it is clearly wanted and requested, and never impose it on anybody: This is sattwic counseling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sat stands for eternal and absolute truth: the Supreme Spirit, above and beyond all vibration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on continued effort until there is no sense of doing, doer, and done because one is merged in the Infinite</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Krishna means also that one should abandon as early as possible the absurd tendency of the doubting mind</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wise understand renunciation to be the relinquishing of any action performed with (personal) desire. They also declare that it is not action itself which should be abandoned, but only that action which desires the fruits of action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tantra is an approach to God that teaches one to be strong in himself in the very teeth of temptation. It is a “back staircase” to God, and spiritually very dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The activity involved in yagya (sacrifice), philanthropic works, and the austerities (listed in 17:14–16) ought certainly to be engaged in, and should not be abandoned, for, when performed with wisdom, (they) purify the heart. (18:6) Even these (self-uplifting) activities, however, ought to be performed without attachment (either) to them or to their fruits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One who gives up a duty because he finds it difficult, or because he fears it will cause him pain, relinquishes that action with rajasic consciousness (motivated by desire and attachment).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(A true disciple of a true guru will never pit one of those against the other.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One who is wise in his renunciation is ever calm in himself, and is never doubtful. He has no aversion to unpleasant actions, nor is he attached to pleasant ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>who thinks of his ego as the sole doer of everything accomplished by him shows no understanding at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as death, but only transition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In divine consciousness, knowing, knower, and known are one and the same. The person is, in fact, the thing known: he is not only the knower. Thus, for example, learning, for him, is no longer difficult, since he already is that knowledge! He is also the act of knowing, which means that, in learning, he doesn’t really absorb anything new.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sattwic action is motivated by superconscious inspiration. It is performed without attachment, without likes or dislikes, and without desire for any fruits accruing from</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sattwic courage, on the other hand, is based on perfect knowledge, and on acceptance of the possible consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Krishna has said there may, occasionally, be a right motivation for fear: when the action one contemplates might put one in karmic error.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>body and senses controlled by pranayama.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When we lift up one hand to God, He reaches two down to help us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even saints manifest tamoguna (tamas), although, relatively speaking, to a very mild degree. They manifest it in the fact that they sleep, or take rest. Even tamasic or very evil people, moreover, show the sattwic quality to a mild degree when they do anything good for anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sense control (by the practice of pranayama),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mind control (concentration), sense control (by the practice of pranayama), self-restraint, purity, forgiveness, integrity, wisdom, meditation to attain Self-realization, and faith in a higher truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The duty of a Vaishya is to include the benefit of others in his own activities. Thus, he will become more sensitive to the needs of others, and will develop, in time, the nature of a Kshatriya.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A true Kshatriya stands up for what he believes, but his rectitude will be appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a duty conflicts with a higher duty, it ceases to be a duty.” In other words, if there are several things one can do well, he should concentrate on that activity which will most expand his sympathies and uplift his consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every human being must follow his own star. The higher one rises toward inner freedom, the more imperative becomes this advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one should not abandon the work dictated by his own nature, even though (the work) contain some imperfection, for all undertakings (even the best) are marred by blemishes, even as a flame is (obscured) by smoke.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That person comes closest to attaining perfection who keeps his intellect non-attached to everything outside the Self, who reigns in victory over the Self, and from whom (all) desires have fled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To know one’s Self is to know God! To know one’s Self is to know everything!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>abiding in a solitary place, eating lightly, controlling the body, speech, and mind; absorbing oneself in divine yoga meditation; dispassionate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>creating a “place of seclusion” in one’s own home. Set aside one room, or even a screened-off portion of your bedroom, where the only activity allowed is meditation. Superconscious vibrations will develop there, and will effectively “screen out” the surrounding, worldly atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now then, do as you feel.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cosmic drama needs suspense, excitement, at times terror, and at other times thrilling beauty. Man needs to feel that the ending to it all is highly uncertain, and may, for him, prove disastrous. Only thus will his interest throughout keep him “on the edge of his seat.” Every soul’s journey is unique. It is filled with uncertainties, with sorrow mingled with joy, with hope mingled with despair, with triumph mingled with crushing defeat, with dark doubt as to whether life has any meaning at all followed by the discovery of human love, of success, of history-making knowledge, of undreamed-of power, of joyful laughter followed by heart-wrenching tears. If man could know, through this long journey, that God’s love was always with him—deeply, eternally, unconditionally—he might well preen himself on that “good fortune,” grow cocky, and never learn the attitudes absolutely necessary for entering into, and becoming one with, that love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never share these truths with one who is without self-control or devotion, nor with one who won’t share with others in a spirit of service, nor give them to one who is indifferent to them, or who finds fault with Me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never try to impose even good ideas on anyone, even if you are sure of those truths in yourself. People need to ask, first. They must seek understanding. To try to force even wisdom on them would be an offense against their eternal birthright of free will.</p>

<h3 id="tribes-we-need-you-to-lead-us-godin-seth">Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us (Godin, Seth)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Generous and authentic leadership will always defeat the selfish efforts of someone doing it just because she can.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Leadership, on the other hand, is about creating change that you believe in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Marketing used to be about advertising, and advertising is expensive. Today, marketing is about engaging with the tribe and delivering products and services with stories that spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>New rule: If you want to grow, you need to find customers who are willing to join you or believe in you or donate to you or support you. And guess what? The only customers willing to do that are looking for something new. The growth comes from change and light and noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One man with no authority suddenly becomes a key figure. Tribes give each of us the very same opportunity. Skill and attitude are essential. Authority is not. In fact, authority can get in the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The movement happens when people talk to one another, when ideas spread within the community, and most of all, when peer support leads people to do what they always knew was the right thing. Great leaders create movements by empowering the tribe to communicate. They establish the foundation for people to make connections, as opposed to commanding people to follow them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>viral activity, or a virtuous cycle. The better you do, the better you do. Connections lead to connections. Great ideas spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few can change everything. What they</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fans, true fans, are hard to find and precious. Just a few can change everything. What they demand, though, is generosity and bravery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations that destroy the status quo win.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the status quo is, changing it gives you the opportunity to be remarkable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the levers are here. The proof is here. The power is here. The only thing holding you back is your own fear. Not easy to admit, but essential to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are leading a tribe, a tribe that you belong to, the benefits increase, the work gets easier, and the results are more obvious. That’s the best reason to overcome the fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize what a badge of honor it is to get a bit of criticism at all. It means that I confounded expectations—that I didn’t deliver the sequel or the simple, practical guide that some expected. It means that, in fact, I did something worth remarking</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They’re generous. They exist to help the tribe find something, to enable the tribe to thrive. But they understand that the most powerful way to enable is to be statueworthy: by getting out front, by making a point, by challenging convention, and by speaking up. Those are brave acts, and bravery begets statues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you identify the discomfort, you’ve found the place where a leader is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaning in or backing off, but not doing nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>trying to lead everyone results in leading no one in particular. This leads to an interesting thought: you get to choose the tribe you will lead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all the growth that’s available to you exists when you aren’t like most people and when you work hard to appeal to folks who aren’t most people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Change isn’t made by asking permission. Change is made by asking forgiveness, later.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is merely about developing the faith that it’ll work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Merely,” of course, is a huge step. It’s nothing but a few neurons’ worth of faith, just the knowledge that you can do it. But without faith, the leap never works.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you fall in love with the system, you lose the ability to grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Training a student to be a sheep is a lot easier than the alternative. Teaching to the test, ensuring compliant behavior, and using fear as a motivator are the easiest and fastest ways to get a kid through school. So why does it surprise us that we graduate so many sheep?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Isn’t it sad that we have a job where we spend two weeks avoiding the stuff we have to do fifty weeks a year?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Life’s too short” is repeated often enough to be a cliché, but this time it’s true. You don’t have enough time to be both unhappy and mediocre. It’s not just pointless, it’s painful. Instead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you ought to set up a life you don’t need to escape from.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>micromovement consist of five things to do and six principles:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>insights per polymath movement</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret of being wrong isn’t to avoid being wrong! The secret is being willing to be wrong. The secret is realizing that wrong isn’t fatal. The only thing that makes people and organizations great is their willingness to be not great along the way. The desire to fail on the way to reaching a bigger goal is the untold secret of success. I’ve been waiting for you to ask for the shortcut, the error-free, failure-free way to get people to do what you want, to make change happen without risk or fear, to magically alter the status quo. That, after all, is the best way to sell you on the ideas here. If I could just give you the answer, you’d be leading a tribe right now. The honest answer is: There isn’t an easy way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret of leadership is simple: Do what you believe in. Paint a picture of the future. Go there. People will follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to switch sides is to admit that we made a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they get when they’re part of a vibrant, growing tribe, but who are still looking for that feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because, of course, it has nothing to do with knowing how the trick is done, and everything to do with the art of doing it. The tactics of leadership are easy. The art is the difficult part.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your tribe communicates. They probably don’t do it the way you would; they don’t do it as efficiently as you might like, but they communicate. The challenge for the leader is to help your tribe sing, whatever form that song takes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea wasn’t the point. Organizing the tribe was.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret, Reagan’s secret, is to listen, to value what you hear, and then to make a decision even if it contradicts the very people you are listening to. Reagan impressed his advisers, his adversaries, and his voters by actively listening. People want to be sure you heard what they said—they’re less focused on whether or not you do what they said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tribes grow when people recruit other people. That’s how ideas spread as well. The tribe doesn’t do it for you, of course. They do it for each other. Leadership is the art of giving people a platform for spreading ideas that work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a myth that change happens overnight, that right answers succeed in the marketplace right away, or that big ideas happen in a flash. They don’t. It’s always (almost always, anyway) a matter of accretion. Drip, drip, drip. Improvements happen a bit at a time, not as grand-slam home runs that are easy to get.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of leadership (a big part of it, actually) is the ability to stick with the dream for a long time. Long enough that the critics realize that you’re going to get there one way or another . . . so they follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no record of Martin Luther King, Jr., or Gandhi whining about credit. Credit isn’t the point. Change is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you choose to lead, you’ll be under huge pressure to reconsider your choice, to compromise, to dumb it down, or to give up. Of course you will. That’s the world’s job: to get you to be quiet and follow. The status quo is the status quo for a reason. But once you choose to lead, you’ll also discover that it’s not so difficult. That the options available to you seem really clear, and that yes, in fact, you can get from here to there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if you create value for others, they’ll happily pay for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a million different ways to approach any topic. The key is: Instead of focusing on the competition, focus on your audience. Who is your audience, and what do they want that they are not being served right now?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be different to be better. Don’t be different for the sake of being different</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are solving a problem that’s important to people, AND if you have the credibility so that they believe you can solve it, then price becomes a mere triviality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To sell, you need to know four key things about your customers: their hopes, dreams, pain points, and fears.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can’t think of anyone to talk to, look for Facebook groups that match your target audience. Then reach out to people in those groups to ask about chatting with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s the psychology that separates the winners from everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thank you for dressing up in a suit and thank you for being professional.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m polite but firm. I’m communicating my value. That’s professionalism</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that first meeting is as little about me as possible. I want to learn from them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, it’s about showing what you can offer them, not asking for anything, and building a relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>attracting a mentor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought I couldn’t go on, and I was getting ready to quit, but instead of letting me quit or even coast, my coach pushed me to do even more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It made me think about how easy it is to quit — and how rare it is to find someone who’ll push you harder than you even thought was possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re capable of 20 times what you think you are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything is figure-out-able.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With each step, your confidence builds, slowly creating powerful, unshakable confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“failing forward,” because each failure propels your business another step ahead, until it’s inevitable that you become successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly recommend you set a tiny, realistic goal for the day. When you achieve it, then move on to the next tiny, realistic goal. Your business is going to see better results from taking action on small goals then dreaming about unrealistic big goals that you never achieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nobody cares what you did. They only care what you’re doing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then we look at the other entrepreneurs around us and use them for support. We ask for help. We ask excellent questions. And together, we all grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All he cares about is the solution that you can offer him.</p>

<li>It is better to think about quality rather than quantity when dealing with sleep. Quality can be determined not only when your are asleep, your routine while you are awake is important too.</li>
<li>Try to improve one step at a time. Little progresses make big differences.</li>
<li>Our biological clocks are regulated by external stimuli such as:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>sunlight</li>
<li>temperature</li>
<li>meal time</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Circadian rhythms work also without external stimuli</li>
<li>Homeostatic pressure determine our need to sleep. This need start when we wake up and keep increase while we are awake.</li>
<li>During night we attain the more efficient sleeping time near 2-3am (twelve hours later there is a compensation time span, it is really common for most of us to feel drowsy.</li>
<li>Light stimulate seratonin production, a neurotransmitter that increase well being and which melatonin is a derivative.</li>
<li>Blue light, dring the day as beneficial effects such as increase performance and reflexes. It is also reduce melatonin levels. It is a bad habit use blue light during the night as you might expect. Professor Idzikowsky define consequences of that bad habit (blue light from monitors before going to sleep) “junk sleep”. It is self explanatory.</li>
<li><p>In literature exist <code>3</code> chronotypes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>He who go to sleep and get up early (<strong>AM</strong>)</li>
<li>He who go to sleep and get up late (<strong>PM</strong>)</li>
<li>He who stay between <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the online quiz and <a href="https://www.bioinfo.mpg.de/mctq/core_work_life/core/introduction.jsp">find what is your chronotype</a> (thanks to University of Monaco).</p></li>
<li>Melatonina is a hormone that is produced by the pineal gland. It regulate your need to go to sleep.</li>
<li>Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. It reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system. Optimal dose for athletes is <code>3-6</code> milligrams per kilograms of body mass. It is a half-life that can be arrive up to six hours. <em>Use caffeine as a power boost, not as a substance that you need in order to do the minimum.</em></li>
<li>Stop waking up late during the weekend, try to keep your morning routine as much as possible.</li>
<li>Is is proven that <code>90</code> minutes is the range needed to pass through each sleep phases. The more important are:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>light sleep</strong>: in which information are consolidated and motor skills performance increase.</li>
<li><p><strong>deep sleep</strong>: brain produce delta wave, the least frequency wave emitted (where we are awake brain produce beta waves that have an higher frequency). More deep sleep the better. We have the most beneficial effects and one of them is the production of growth hormone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>born new cells, fix tissue and leave a feeling of renewal.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>REM (Rapid Eye Movement)</strong>: dreaming phase, here the mind trick us with dreams while the body is paralyzed. Studies report that <strong>REM sleep increase creativity</strong>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It is not possible to get back lost sleep. Try to go to bed early or sleep for too long is time wasted. Our body is able to adapt, if you want to recover something, focus on keep your routine without too much worrying.</li>
<li>Keep a fix time to wake up is the best method we have to increase our sleeping quality.</li>
<li>Focus on <strong>cycles</strong> per night. A cycle is <strong>90 minutes of sleep</strong>.</li>
<li>Try to find out how many cycles are best suite for us. If for example we have seen that we need <code>5</code> cycles per night, we must try to not have three consecutive nights with less cycles. It is really important to find out <strong>How many cycles we need to feel restful and increase our daily routine performance</strong>. We must be ready to feel our body and mind responses while change cycles per night. Try at least for a week before switch.</li>
<li>Do not think that sleep can only be done only monophasically. In a time window of 24 hours there are other opportunities to compensate a poor night sleep.</li>
<li>Our biggest problem is psychological. Common bias that we need <code>8</code> hours of sleep per night is a real beast. It is difficult now think that <code>4.30</code> is enough.</li>
<li>When we get older, our sleep habit shift one bit at a time from a monophasic to a polyphasic sleep.</li>
<li>Sleep on your side is the recommended position. Better if your slave side, because is the side least used so less sensible. In addition, the dominant side can be think as “the reactive” side that can help you defense against attacks while sleeping (in order to sleep well we need to feel secure).</li>
<li>Try to use your bedroom only for sleeping activities.</li>
<li>“<em>Mouth breathing increase the number of sleep apnoea as well as probability to snore.</em>” - Patrick McKeown <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26533127-the-oxygen-advantage">The Oxygen Advantage</a></li>
<li>You can find if you have a good mattress if while you are on your side, the distance between the mattress and your head is less than two fist.</li>
<li>Double bed, as the word say <strong>must</strong> be at least <code>180</code> centimeters (width). Lesser the space we have higher is the probability to disturb our or our partner sleep. Sleep with someone else have benefits <strong>pre</strong> and <strong>post</strong> sleep. In an ideal world, we only [pre/post]sleep together.</li>
<li>Duvet optimal values: <code>13,5</code> tog during winter, <code>4,5</code> tog during summer, <code>9,0</code> tog during autumn and spring. In hot summer obviously we can use only a duvet cover or nothing at all.</li>
<li>Bedroom best practices:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>minimal forniture, cleaned space and color neutral.</li>
<li>can be totally overshadowed (use a night mask can be bothersome, we must be as free as possible).</li>
<li>temperature should be between <code>16-18</code> celsius degree.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Use your bed only for sleeping.</li>
<li>Try to avoid a bottle of water near the bed. Think: why do you need it? If you wake up with a dry throat probably is because you are breathing with your mouth while sleeping. If you wake up in order to go to the bathroom, maybe you have drink too much before sleep. In addition keep a bottle of water near your bed, let your mind think about it during night, with higher probability to think you need a sip.</li>
<li>The best alarm clock is a sunrise simulator. A device useful not only for whom suffering SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) but for everyone that try to wake up with a “sunrise”. A sunrise simulator has beneficial brain and body effects in addition to emotional feelings and well being.</li>
<li>Benefits that come with <strong>R90 program</strong> (all tips mentioned above and below) become effective only in addition to good nutrition and body exercises. Tackle these three problems together and each one enhance benefits to the rest. Your life surely will be better.</li>
<li>Tryptophan is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it and thus it must be obtained from the diet (fish, banana, dried fruit). Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin and the hormone melatonin. Sport athletes use <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1082898/">Montmorency’s cherry</a> as bio-hacking supplement. Glyn Howatson professor of Northumbria University has lead numerous studies that prove his beneficial effects and his efficiency after an intensive physical activity. In addition Glyn proved that these black berry increase melatonin production.</li>
<li>Oregon State University stated that <code>150</code> minutes of physical training per week, enhance sleep quality by <code>65%</code>.</li>
<li>Sleeping pills can give addiction, memory loss and sleepwalking</li>
<li>Think about your sleep in a time window of <code>7</code> days. One night is not enough to draw conclusions</li>
<li><p>Usually it is more problematic to <strong>travel</strong> eastward rather than westward. Good tips are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to bed and get up early some days before your departure.</li>
<li>Expose to sunlight early each day and avoid it during the evening</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunlights</strong> is a lot of more effective rather than caffeine to keep you awake and sleeping pills to make you sleep.</p></li>
<li>An unbalanced sleep, typical to shift workers can lead to different problems such as depression, immune system imbalance, increase risk for cancer, cronic cardiopathy and metabolism disorders (type 2 diabetes). It is proven that being under these changes has severe health consequences. A study done to a sample of <code>70.000</code> nurses with a time window of 22 years has proven that after 5 years of shift work, probabilities to early death increase. Play with our internal clock has consequences. Always.</li>
<li><strong>winter blues</strong>: winter tendency to slow down mood and wants. You can try to avoid winter blues trying to go out and get direct sunlight between 11am to 16pm</li>
<li>National Sleep Foundation recommend for newborns from 14 to 17 sleep hours per day. A quantity that decrease while children grow. 9 to 11 when they start to go to school and 8 to 10 at the age of fourteen.</li>
<li>Help your children to sleep well using pre and post routines and avoid/banish stimulant substances such as sugars.</li>
<li>Teenagers sleep more because is your body that need more sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-sleep-routine">Pre Sleep Routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>A pre-sleep routine enhance your sleeping quality. Sometimes is better to reduce sleeping time in order to do your routine. Remember that it is a way much better <strong>quality</strong> rather than <strong>quantity</strong> in sleep.</li>
<li>Keep your bedroom with fresh air (not cold) is really important.</li>
<li>Have a warm shower rise your body temperature. When you get into bed, a little colder than you, works as naturally thermal excursion. In addition a lot of people feel comfortable getting into bed clean. It is not indispensable having a full shower, a rinse is enough.</li>
<li>Intensive training during afternoon or even evening increase bloody pressure (already at his maximum levels at that time) and for that reason it is not recommended before sleep, above all for the erderly. However going for a walk, yoga, stretching or low intensive exercises are recommended because as we said earlier rising your body temperature before sleeping can help.</li>
<li>Soften all surroundings is another tip. Switch off lights or keep them low, if possible choose lights with a warm color temperature.</li>
<li><p>Recommended activities:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Have a shower</li>
<li>Tidy up</li>
<li>Writing (thoughts, appointments, TODOs for the next day, stoic diary, …)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote></li>
<li>You might eat at least <code>3</code> hours before going to sleep. It is possible to have a snack but only before your pre-sleep routine (that is around <code>90</code> minutes).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="post-sleep-routine">Post Sleep Routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>Post sleep routine enhance our efficiency during the day.</li>
<li>If you wake up and your mouth is dry probably you breath throughout your mouth while asleep. Conversely if your mouth is wet, you are using your nose to breathe.</li>
<li>Cortisol (steroid hormone released in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration) has his maximal level soon after your wake up time. It is useful start your day with relaxing activities, such as meditation, yoga, daily journal, reading…</li>
<li>When you wake up, get direct sunlight, it enhance our clarity of mind, it balance our biological clock and it prepare our body to switch from melatonin production to serotonin production.</li>
<li>Avoid un-healthy snacks (with too much sugar or difficult to digest).</li>
<li>If it is possible, have breakfast outdoor or at least in a room with a lot of sunlight. If outside the sun is not rise yet, switch on an artificial natural light.</li>
<li>It is a good habit doing some exercises, both high or low intensive. Having a walk, yoga, Taiji..</li>
<li>Easy mental activities such as listen to the radio, iron some clothes, tidy up, read and fix something are welcome.</li>

<li>It is not necessary to have perfect conditions. You can make a nap while you are in a sitting position.</li>
<li>It is not important if you fall asleep or not. It is important that you take advantage of this resting time, <em>“switching off”</em> your brain.</li>
<li>Find a way to rest. Rest improve your efficiency and concentration, it is scientifically proven.</li>
<li>In addition, switching off your brain reduce stress and keep your productivity high during all day.</li>
<li>If you sleep (<code>1</code> cycle, <code>90</code> minutes, or more) during the day, it is preferred to choose between (<code>13-15</code>, <code>1pm-3pm</code>) and (<code>17-19</code>, <code>5pm-7pm</code>). The first one is better because is like the night period between <code>2am</code> and <code>3am</code> where the circadian stimulus is at his higher rate.</li>
</ul>
