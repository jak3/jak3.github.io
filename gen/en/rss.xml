<h1 id="penetrating-wisdom">Penetrating Wisdom</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Through thegradual intensification of habit Sequential entry into samsdra began.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dualism is doubt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>faith, faith without any questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is devotion and trust in the inconceivable truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest obstacle in the path of Tantra, in the paths of Vajrayana, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen, is completely and utterly trusting these ordinary perceptions. The truth is out there and it cannot be experienced by these low-tech perceptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic meaning here begins with faith in this inconceivable truth. In Vajrayana, that is the fundamental faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is trust and faith in the fruition of the path as well as in the teachings that lead us to the fruition of enlightenment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vajrayana goes beyond logic. This is a very important point. Vajrayana is like asking someone to wake you up in the morning. You are not relying on an alarm clock. You are relying on this person, the Vajra master, to wake you up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Devotion involves wisdom and knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So you see, two seemingly ordinary and unimportant things can be very important in Tantra. You can never tell what is not important. Only the Vajra master can tell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a big difference between individual understanding and individual interpretation. That is why Buddha taught three yanas. Although Buddha gave many teachings, we only hear what we want to hear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we may misunderstand and say there is no space at all in the Vajrayana for any kind of doubt. That’s not true. It is very very dangerous to say that we must not have any doubts! Buddha said doubt is wisdom. He said that inquisitive mind is wisdom. We are more than welcome to have doubts and inquisitive mind about the path and practices. At the same time, we must not go so far with these doubts that we get caught up and carried away by them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These problems of selective practice, selective hearing, and selective guru become our major obstacles on the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>called “the great perfection.” To convey fully the meaning of Dzogchen in English, the expression “full stop” is quite good. Full stop. Period. This period is a little but very powerful dot called the full stop. There is the sense of being full in that this dot has a circular form that is complete and full. At the same time, everything stops here: it doesn’t go beyond this period. Dzogchen has a similar meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Vajrayana path is known as the path of fruition because we are not working with causes to produce the result. Instead, we are taking the result as the path.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there’s a saying in the Dzogchen literature, “The happiness Kuntuzangpo or the suffering Kuntuzangpo.” Happiness is utterly pure and suffering is utterly pure. In the ultimate space of Kuntuzangpo, there are no differences between happiness and suffering, just as there are no differences between inside and outside.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Milarepa said that between two conceptual discursive thoughts, you experience nonconceptual wisdom. There is a moment of nonconceptual wisdom in between thoughts. We don’t realize that, we just miss it all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One problem with our human mind is that we like complexity, we are addicted to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>group karma, beings in each of the different realms experience a common world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when the motivation is pure, the benefit is greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there are no people who irritate you, then how can you perfect the paramita of patience? If there are no people to make you angry, how can you perfect the paramita of discipline? If there are no people or phenomena to distract your mind from the perfect samadhi, then how can you perfect the path of the paramita of discipline</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to go through the different stages of experiences and not get attached to them. Go continuously on the path. Eventually, that will lead to realization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One is free from these five poisons if one’s sensory perceptions simply experience what they are without labeling thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are not bound to samsara by appearances, you are bound to samsara by conceptual attachment. Therefore my son, Naropa, cut the root of this attachment.” The appearances of the world outside, which are the experiences of the five sensory perceptions, are not a problem. The problem here is the labeling process that follows it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever sensory experiences we go through, if we go through them with mindfulness and awareness, there is no limit to how far we can go. The limit is mindfulness and awareness. Even if we don’t enjoy the experience, that itself becomes a trip.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither alayavijnana or alayajnana matters at first, just get the stillness. In that stillness, the alayajnana arises naturally and without struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We identify our guests, “Oh, my visitor is Mr. Anger” or “This time my visitor is Mr. Jealousy” or “This visitor is Mr. Ignorance.”Then, with the great Mahayana compassion and the Vajrayana fearlessness,you open the door. We won’t leave our guest outside, we will invite him in. Be with it, that’s the reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a nightmare, or has some painful illusion in a dream, a person with clairvoyance can see that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tantric teachings are said to really benefit those who have very strong poisons, very strong emotions. For that reason, the wrathful deities play a stronger role on the path of awakening in Tantra.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But at a certain point, some kind of very unpleasant situation comes up that really gets us into that state. That unpleasant situation really clicks us into the state of truly understanding and appreciating impermanence. It clicks us into understanding shunyata and appreciating the notion of emptiness. That happens all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are making the aspiration that they obtain the ultimate wealth and the ultimate joy, which is the recognition of primordial buddha mind. That is our aspiration here. But our aspiration is not only to recognize this primordial ground of buddhahood. Once we have recognized this ground, we aspire that such wisdom then expands and shines out. We aspire that by recognizing this ground, the boundless wisdom of beings grows to the infinite space of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“May all sentient beings, including ourselves, be in the state of our fundamental buddhahood that is the primordial buddha Samantabhadra.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to do an aspiration to benefit others, this is a beautiful aspiration for all beings of the six realms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning, you should put some effort into your postmeditation practice. For example, you should try to remember to watch your mind, watch your thoughts, at least once every hour. That’s very good practice already. If you do it every hour, it is already a great achievement. Later, that effort will bring the sense of effortless awareness in everyday life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The five elements manifest from these five lights. The water element manifests from white light. The earth element manifests from yellow light. The fire element manifests from red light. The wind element manifests from green light, and the space element manifests from blue light. These are the five elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to identify the emotion in which we are engaged, even though it is often mixed. Passion, aggression, jealousy, and so on are all mixed at certain points. Identifying them is the process that naturally takes us to mindfulness, to awareness. There is no other way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step is just simply to observe it. Simply recognize the emotion and then watch it as it grows or as it continues. Just simply watch it. In the beginning, just to have an idea that it’s coming is very important and very effective. In the Vajrayana sense, the way to watch these emotions is without stopping them. If we recognize the emotion and say,“Yes, it is passion,” and then try to stop it, that’s a problem. Rejecting our emotions is a problem in Vajrayana.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just being mindless itself is a distraction. That’s the most subtle distraction we ever experience in our meditation path. Usually, we think of distraction as being something very active. We think of it as a dualistic interaction between an outside object and one of the six sensory perceptions. But distraction here is simply being unmindful, being unaware.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The labeling process is a very subtle way of planting and growing this seed of ignorance in our mindstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the most gross element of this ignorance is the division between self and other. The labeling process has matured to the stage where we can clearly see the dualistic barrier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With diligence and exertion, we can reach a point where effort becomes effortless. However, at the beginning we need to exert ourselves. In order to exert ourselves, we need discipline. That’s why the paramita practices are so practical. The paramita practices are common to both Tantra and Sutra. We can begin with discipline, which is the cause of diligence, and discipline enforces our diligence. Diligence doesn’t come without renunciation and without seeing the possibility of freedom. Therefore, they are all connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning, it’s just the mechanism. We are just starting the movement, which itself has a subtle craving. A subtle attachment is developed in that subconscious move.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Attachment is actually the greatest suffering of all sentient beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing called beautiful outside. Even in our mundane wisdom, we have the saying that beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we have one good master, another one always looks kinder. The other one always looks much more skilled, much more intelligent, and so on. Then we flip back and forth with our teachers, the same as we do with everything else. That is the totally chaotic path called the hungry ghost realm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In classical Buddhist paintings, the hungry ghosts are sitting right next to a beautiful lake while, at the same time, they are burning inside with thirst. Even while they burn inside with thirst, they have this stinginess. They think that the water will be completely consumed if they drink, so they never drink. It is said that even if the hungry ghosts drink, they burn inside even more because they worry about losing this wealth of water. If we are not mindful, this hungry ghost psychological state can happen to us at any time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever lust, passion, attachment, or desire arises, the method given here is not to reject these emotions. It is to let them come, let them arise. There is no need to suppress this emotion. There is nothing wrong with its appearance. The raw energy of lust and passion is in the state of buddha wisdom. The Prayer says that whenever they arise, we should not go under the power of the labeling process, the power of conceptualizing the raw energy of lust and passion. We go through this experience of tremendous energy called passion. What usually happens is that we conceptualize it later. That conceptualization leads us into an endless chain of thoughts and an endless chain of labeling. That endless chain of thoughts and labeling leads us to all sorts of different emotions, such as anger and jealousy, that become problematic.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just simply experience the emotion, neither reject it nor accept it. The raw energy is simply experienced without any thought, without any labeling process. Just simply be in that space. The Prayer says that this brings the wisdom of perfect discernment, discriminating wisdom, which corresponds to the wisdom of the western buddha field of Amitabha.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem here is not the passion. It is not the lust nor is it the desire. The problem is that we are not leaving them alone. We are not letting them be what they are. We are disturbing them with the labeling process, the thought process. We are not letting lust be lust, we are not letting desire be desire, we are not letting passion be passion. Therefore, the mind becomes agitated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are the creator of these states as well as the experiencer of these states.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The pain that we see in the hell realm is the creation of our mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you conquer just one enemy, your aggression, it is like conquering all the objects of this anger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to destroy an object, look inside and find the true enemy, which is aggression. Conquer that. Shantideva said that anger is very destructive. He said that one moment of hatred or anger can destroy the virtue of many eons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, one moment of anger, aggression, or hatred can wipe out the data of all the virtuous actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it would be harmful to have thoughts of hatred toward those surrounding you, but it is much more harmful to yourself than to any other person.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mahayana and Vajrayana views say that whatever we experience, whatever we perceive, is basically our own creation. There is no outer creation and no outer creator. The creator is right here. If we are seeing nice beautiful scenery, it is our own creation. If we are seeing a horrible world outside or a horrible experience inside, it is also our creation. It is our mind’s experience. This is a very important element in these teachings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Buddhism, when we talk about mind-only, it doesn’t mean that the other person doesn’t exist. What we are saying is that the way we perceive, the way we relate, the way we see phenomena, is very much our mind only. It is our creation. We are projecting outside and we are perceiving that projection. It’s very much our perception only. It is our conception only. In the same way, this hell realm is a creation of our mind. We are projecting all these weird things outside and going through tremendous unnecessary pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>this emotion called pride. It is very dangerous and destructive because it causes us to refrain from learning. It blocks us from improving ourselves. Having pride means the end of our growing, the end of our development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If the pot is upside down, no matter how much water you try to pour in, you can’t fill it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the definition of pride; an attitude of superiority to others. We get into the suffering of disputation because we feel superior.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main thing that we need to learn is how to be in whatever state we are in. We need to learn to be in that state completely, honestly, and without trying to pretend to be something better or something different.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We learn to be in the raw state of the emotion itself, without altering it, without trying to be something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main problem of jealousy is lack of appreciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s what we call competitiveness, always wanting more than what we have.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We go through a painful experience of praising and denigrating. Praising oneself directly or indirectly, and denigrating others directly or indirectly, is the continual process of struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Buddha said that if you rejoice in the merit arising from whatever positive actions others may be involved in, you get the same merit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we’re attached to sleep so we don’t take delight in waking up, and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anger has the same kind of quality. It’s very awakening in its nature but we usually paint it more than it requires or needs. We have to simply experience it. When you experience it, just experience it. Just rest in it. Don’t hate it and don’t follow it with any more thoughts, any more paintings. Just be. Just sort of let it be. It comes close to the end of words at a certain point.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the method, we have a tradition in Mahayana practice of reviewing the whole day. Every evening in our last session of meditation, we review the whole day. We try to think about the major emotional events that occurred during the day. We recollect whether we had a major anger, a major passion, or a major experience of hatred during that day. Then we really try to see it and we try to see how we handled it. Maybe we were somewhat successful, maybe we failed. We also try to see how many positive thoughts we had. See how many good thoughts that we had, such as thoughts of compassion. If we do that in our last meditation, we can see our ignorance pretty clearly. We can see our ignorance in these experiences of screwing up our opportunities to recognize rigpa. By reflecting, we can try to recognize ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O Lord, bestow on us mercy from Thyself, and provide for us a right course of action!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To ask blessing” means “to commit all one’s affairs to God and to be saved from, the various sorts of contamination”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The believer’s intention is better than his performance.” Great is the power of intention, through which a man advances from one category to another without any external change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A good intention, therefore, is preliminary to the due performance of every act.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone makes pretensions, none attains to reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>knowledge should not be separated from action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ḥátim al-Asamm said: “I have chosen four things to know, and have discarded all the knowledge in the world besides.” He was asked: “What are they?” “One,” he answered, “is this: I know that my daily bread is apportioned to me, and will neither be increased nor diminished; consequently I have ceased to seek to augment it. Secondly, I know that I owe to God a debt which no other person can pay instead of me; therefore I am occupied with paying it. Thirdly, I know that there is one pursuing me (i.e. Death) from whom I cannot escape; accordingly I have prepared myself to meet him. Fourthly, I know that God is observing me; therefore I am ashamed to do what I ought not”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a sect of heretics called Sophists (Súfisṭá’iyán), who believe that nothing can be known and that knowledge itself does not exist. I say to them: “You think that nothing can be known; is your opinion correct or not?” If they answer “It is correct”, they thereby affirm the reality of knowledge; and if they reply “It is not correct”, then to argue against an avowedly incorrect assertion is absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Knowledge is of three kinds—from God, with God, and of God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You must know enough to know that you do not know.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“True perception is to despair of attaining perception, But not to advance on the paths of the virtuous is polytheism.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the dervish is a place over which something is passing, not a wayfarer following his own will.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet said, repeating the words thrice: “Thou knowest, therefore persevere.”]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>renunciation is of two kinds: formal and essential. For example, if one renounces a pleasure, and finds pleasure in the renunciation, this is formal renunciation; but if the pleasure renounces him, then the pleasure is annihilated, and this case falls under the head of true contemplation (musháhadat).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To-day Ṣúfiism is a name without a reality, but formerly it was a reality without a name,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you wish to show to the people that you belong to God, should your claim be true, you are guilty of ostentation; and should it be false, of hypocrisy. The Ṣúfís are too great to need a special garment for this purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A dervish must not have less than three things: first, he must know how to sew on a patch rightly; second, he must know how to listen rightly; third, he must know how to set his foot on the ground rightly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when anything has become habitual to the soul it soon grows natural, and when it has grown natural it becomes a veil.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first year is devoted to service of the people, the second year to service of God, and the third year to watching over his own heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He whose poverty is compulsory is more perfect than he whose poverty is voluntary; for if it be compulsory, he is the creature (ṣan‘at) of poverty, and if it be voluntary, poverty is his creature; and it is better that his actions should be free from any attempt to gain poverty for himself than that he should seek to acquire it by his own effort.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not let your wife and children be your chief cares; for if they be friends of God, God will look after His friends, and if they are enemies of God, why should you take care of God’s enemies?” This question is connected with the severance of the heart from all things save God, who keeps His servants in whatever state He willeth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou dost never turn away the beggar, and no creature in earth or heaven can prevent the true believer who implores Thee from gaining access to Thy court.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When God wishes a man well, He gives him insight into his faults.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>true solitary is not disturbed by society, but he who is preoccupied seeks in vain to acquire freedom from thought by secluding himself. In order to be cut off from mankind one must become intimate with God, and those who have become intimate with God are not hurt by intercourse with mankind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Keep watch over thy heart” (’alayka bi-qalbika), i.e. “Guard thy heart from thoughts of ‘other’”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my asceticism in this world is desire for the next world, and this is the quintessence of desire. How excellent is he who takes no thought of his own interest! so that his patience is for God’s sake, not for the saving of himself from Hell; and his asceticism is for God’s sake, not for the purpose of bringing himself into Paradise. This is the mark of true sincerity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The deed that I love best is sincerity in doing,” because an action only becomes an action in virtue of its sincerity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is better to fulfil the duty which is owed to one’s mother than to make the pilgrimage. Return, therefore, and try to please her.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a man is overcome with love for the Agent, he attains to such a degree that in looking at His act he does not see the act but the Agent only and entirely, just as when one looks at a picture and sees only the painter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Practise what you have learned, for theory without practice is like a body without a spirit.” He who is content with learning alone is not learned, and the truly learned man is not content with learning alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no knowledge without action, since knowledge is the product of action, and is brought forth and developed and made profitable by the blessings of action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the more one loves, the more one is obedient, and love is increased by true knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A moment’s reflection is better than sixty years of devotion,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The sleep of the sage is an act of devotion and the wakefulness of the fool is a sin,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kun lilláh wa-illá lá takun, “Be God’s or be nothing,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“O God, whatever punishment Thou mayst inflict upon me, do not punish me with the humiliation of being veiled from Thee,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Thy beauty is revealed to our hearts, we take no thought of affliction</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Lust is of three kinds—lust in eating, lust in speaking, and lust in looking. Guard thy food by trust in God, thy tongue by telling the truth, and thine eye by taking example (’ibrat).”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not lust when thou receivest food from Him and eatest by His leave, or when thou speakest of Him by His leave, or when thou seest His actions by His leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear and hope are the two pillars of faith. It is impossible that anyone should fall into error through practising either of them. Those who fear engage in devotion through fear of separation (from God), and those who hope engage in it through hope of union (with God).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore Man cannot properly take or leave anything; it is God who in His providence gives and takes away, and Man only takes what God has given or leaves what God has taken away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I left work and returned to it; then work left me and I never returned to it again,” because when anyone leaves a thing by one’s own act and effort, the leaving of it is no better than the taking of</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the marvels of Divine action are in nothing manifested more clearly than in human hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let him be occupied with himself in order that he may see learning everywhere, and let him turn from himself to God in order that he may see gnosis everywhere. Let him seek learning and gnosis in himself, and let him demand practice and reality from himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Those who regard things as determined by God turn to God in everything,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A thing can be explained only by what is more subtle than itself: there is nothing subtler than love: by what, then, shall love be explained</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His biographers relate that for forty years he never slept; then he fell asleep and dreamed of God. “O Lord,” he cried, “I was seeking Thee in nightly vigils, but I have found Thee in sleep.” God answered: “O Sháh, you have found Me by means of those nightly vigils: if you had not sought Me there, you would not have found Me here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the heart is the seat of knowledge of God and is more venerable than the Ka‘ba, to which men turn in devotion. Men are ever looking towards the Ka‘ba, but God is ever looking towards the heart. Wherever the heart is, my Beloved is there; wherever His decree is, my desire is there; wherever the traces of my prophets1 are, the eyes of those whom I love are directed there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anyone who is ignorant of the nature of servantship (’ubúdiyyat) is yet more ignorant of the nature of lordship (rubúbiyyat),” i.e., whoever does not know the way to knowledge of himself does not know the way to knowledge of God, and whoever does not recognize the contamination of human qualities does not recognize the purity of the Divine attributes, inasmuch as the outward is connected with the inward, and he who claims to possess the former without the latter makes an absurd assertion. Knowledge of the nature of lordship depends on having right principles of servantship, and is not perfect without them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Presence (ḥuḍúr) is better than certainty (yaqín), because presence is an abiding state (waṭanát), whereas certainty is a transient one (khaṭarát),” i.e., presence makes its abode in the heart and does not admit forgetfulness, while certainty is a feeling that comes and goes: hence those who are “present” (ḥáḍirán) are in the sanctuary, and those who have certainty (múqinán) are only at the gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“At thy service” (labbayk),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, when persons of true spirituality and insight have visions, they make no effort to describe them, and do not occupy themselves with self-admiration on that account, and are careless of praise and blame alike, and are undisturbed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“speaking tongues are the destruction of silent hearts”. Such expressions are entirely mischievous. Expression of the meaning of reality is futile. If the meaning exists it is not lost by expression, and if it is non-existent it is not created by expression. Expression only produces an unreal notion and leads the student mortally astray by causing him to imagine that the expression is the real meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God never leaves the earth without a proof (ḥujjat) or the Moslem community without a saint, as the Apostle said: “One sect of my people shall continue in goodness and truth until the hour of the Resurrection.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the name of dervish is applied to anyone whose heart subsists in the contemplation of God?’ i.e. those who contemplate God are rich in God» whereas dervishes (fuqará) are occupied with self-mortification.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ṣúﬁism is the subsistence of the heart with God without any mediation.” This alludes to contemplation (musháhadat),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Station” belongs to the category of acts, “state” to the category of gifts. Hence the man that has a “station” stands by his own self-mortification, whereas the man that has a “state” is dead to “self” and stands by a “state” which God creates in him.</p>

<p>phlegm, blood, bile, and melancholy, which four humours correspond to the four elements of this world, viz. water, earth, air, and fire, while his soul (ján), his lower soul (nafs) and his body correspond to Paradise, Hell, and the place of Resurrection. Paradise is the effect of God’s satisfaction, and Hell is the result of His anger. Similarly, the spirit of the true believer reflects the peace of knowledge, and his lower soul the error which veils him from God. As, at the Resurrection, the believer must be released from Hell before he can reach Paradise and attain to real vision and pure love, so in this world he must escape from his lower soul before he can attain to real discipleship (irádat), of which the spirit is the principle, and to real proximity (to God) and gnosis.</p>

<p>One says, “He who seeks shall find,” and the other says, “He who finds shall seek.” Seeking is the cause of finding, but it is no less true that finding is the cause of seeking.</p>

<p>Mortification will never turn a donkey into a horse or a horse into a donkey, because this involves a change of identity; and since mortification has not the power of transforming identity it cannot possibly be affirmed in the presence of God.</p>

<p>“trust in God is a term denoting your conduct towards God and your spiritual excellence in regard to relying on Him: if a man spends his whole life in remedying his spiritual nature, he will need another life for remedying his material nature, and his life will be lost before he has found a trace or vestige of God”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although a man has no power over what is vicious in his constitution, he can get an attribute changed by Divine aid and by resigning himself to God’s will and by divesting himself of his own power and strength. In reality, when he resigns himself, God protects him; and through God’s protection he comes nearer to annihilating the evil than he does through self-mortification, since flies are more easily driven away with an umbrella (mikanna) than with a fly-whisk (midhabba).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The saint is annihilated in his own state and subsistent in the contemplation of the Truth: he cannot tell anything concerning himself, nor can he rest with anyone except God,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to communicate one’s hidden state to another is to reveal the secret of the Beloved, which cannot be revealed except to the Beloved himself. Moreover, in contemplation it is impossible to regard aught except God:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The saint hath no fear, because fear is the expectation either of some future calamity or of the eventual loss of some object of desire, whereas the saint is the son of his time (ibn waqtihi): he has no future that he should fear anything; and as he hath no fear so he hath no hope, since hope is the expectation either of gaining an object of desire or of being relieved from a misfortune, and this belongs to the future; nor does he grieve, because grief arises from the rigour of time, and. how should he feel grief who is in the radiance of satisfaction (riḍá) and the garden of concord (muwáfaqat)?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear and hope and security and grief all refer to the interests of the lower soul, and when that is annihilated satisfaction (riḍá) becomes an attribute of Man, and when satisfaction has been attained his states become steadfast (mustaqím) in vision of the Author of states (muḥawwil), and his back is turned on all states. Then saintship is revealed to his heart and its meaning is made clear to his inmost thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Do not covet anything in this world or the next, and devote thyself entirely to God, and turn to God with all thy heart.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no “station” on the way to the Truth where any obligation of service is abolished.</p>

<p>Abraham, in the beginning of his state, looked on the sun and said: “This is my Lord,” and he looked on the moon and stars and said: “This is my Lord” (Kor. vi, 76–8), because his heart was overwhelmed by the Truth and he was united in the essence of union.</p>

As is the way of young men, I answered (without consideration) that I was fasting. He asked why. I said: “In conformity with such and such a one.” He said: “It is not right for human beings to conform with human beings.” I was about to break my fast, but he said: “Since you wish to be quit of conformity with him, do not conform with me, for I too am a human being.”</p>

<p>The evils of celibacy are two: (1) the neglect of an Apostolic custom, (2) the fostering of lust in the heart and the danger of falling into unlawful ways.

<blockquote>
<p>neither state (marriage or celibacy) should be regarded with predilection, in order that we may see what the decree of Divine providence will bring to light: if celibacy be our lot, we should strive to be chaste, and if marriage be our destiny, we should comply with the custom of the Apostle and strive to clear our hearts (of worldly anxieties).</p>

<h1 id="living-presence-a-sufi-way-to-mindfulness-the-essential-self">Living Presence: A Sufi Way to Mindfulness &amp; the Essential Self</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>the real Work is to serve, to pay attention to how other human beings can be helped toward freedom and love by being an example of those qualities without expectation of any recognition or reward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, what attracts us in the outer world is only putting us in touch with the hidden treasure within us. Through finding it in ourselves we are returned to the Being that we reflect. We are not the originators of qualities, but the reflectors of the infinite qualities of Being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>that point where the horizontal force of active choice meets the vertical force of Being, a certain “something,” larger than life, will be activated. This “something” can be felt in anything produced by the hands and heart of a conscious human being—in works of art, in a well-tended garden, in food prepared with love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In sacred art, performance is not a means of ego gratification but an offering to the Divine. What is offered is everyone’s attention, and yet everyone is elevated in this sacred alchemy and feels a change of consciousness through this quality of performance and the attention offered.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as we are the servants of Spirit, Spirit is our servant when we make our connection to it. This connection is made through presence, which is a receptivity to the energies of possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a human being is whatever his or her attention is focused on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Attention develops as the gatekeeper of all our impressions. We learn not to let the mind wander too far from the essential Self, even while we are open to outer things. More and more we work to keep our attention on Being itself. We can learn to call upon a very refined attention, to keep an awareness of the deepest truths in the most ordinary circumstances. This can be done only if our attention is not easily coerced and distracted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>child to experience an environment of love, support, and trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>desire (eros), friendship (philia), or unconditional love (agape).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we can become nothing by limiting our habitual self-centered thoughts. This will cut at the root of our egotism, because ego exists in our thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we could just be, we would be able to escape the anxiety of becoming something that we are not, getting something we don’t have, and trying to shape reality according to our own desires.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>what we most need is what we already are: our essential Self. There is no escape; there is only coming home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Submission is to live for one’s Self—the eternal I—not for one’s ego.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Divani Shamsi Tabriz 120):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The tamer of the ego is love. We must learn to love even the ego; then the ego can submit to that love. Perhaps we need to consider what the ego is and how to live with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to establish a subtle balance—the ego in harmonious cocreatorship with the Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is essential to learn to relax within the tensions of life. We cannot escape conflict in this world, but we can learn to relax within it. This has nothing to do with running from conflict and certainly nothing to do with repressing it. This relaxation has aspects of trust, surrender, and submission. Balance is necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>obstacles are the neurotic manifestations of ego that are produced by various kinds of physical, mental, and emotional tensions, whether aggressiveness, timidity, self-righteousness, self-doubt, arrogance, shame, hypocrisy, envy, jealousy, suspicion, or greed. In such states the ego will work overtime to maintain itself and its illusions. And we may not be aware how these tensions distort our features, and our souls.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can be thankful for our faults, for they can keep us humble and aware of our dependence on a higher Reality, without which we would never be transformed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let go of your worries and be completely clear-hearted, like the face of a mirror that contains no images. When it is empty of forms, all forms are contained within it. No face would be ashamed to be so clear.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Work is to bring the outer and the inner into harmony.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This requires attention to our intention. If our intention is clear and sound, and if it is periodically remembered and reaffirmed, there will be a mental, emotional, and practical integration in realizing the intention.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a polish for everything,” said Muhammad, peace and blessings upon him, “and the polish for the heart is the remembrance of God”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since in order to speak, one must first listen, learn to speak by listening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Attention can be called the first act of the will.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>not really enjoying their company or giving them my real attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we live with a real question and a sense of purpose, the whole mind is more likely to function harmoniously and creatively. More and more we will also begin to have experiences of pure presence free of thought. Opening to life without preconception, without the veil of habitual thought, we will perceive Being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Humility is the foremost act of worship”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If attention is not connected to will, a human is not fully a human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What can you do with will that you can’t do without it? A day later the answer came simple and clear: Be free.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We learn that awareness of our breath and physical presence can greatly assist this gathering. And we learn that to be identified with any single function, such as thinking or feeling, is to lose that comprehensive self-awareness we call “presence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret to developing an integrated self is to intentionally extend awareness to more than one function at a time. Each function that comes into awareness adds another coordinate to our conscious existence. If, for instance, we are fully occupied with an emotion and become aware of our breathing or our physical sensations, we have generated more presence. If those of us who live mostly in our heads, in repetitive and limited thinking, both add an awareness of something physical such as our breathing and come into touch with our feelings, we have extended our presence greatly. We have more coordinates. Instead of a one-dimensional person we have suddenly become a three- or four-dimensional person.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>all outer things are reminders of Being itself: Wherever you look is the face of the Friend. Eventually this process can become circular—presence welling up inside us and moving outward, the outer world being consciously recognized and returned to its source through our awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we can use the body to develop greater presence</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Salaah is a form that integrates mindfulness, mental precision, affirmation, devotion, and stretching.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>unconscious theta state can be facilitated by increasing the length of time of exhalation, as in many forms of chanting or singing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have faith means to have a center, an axis, a single point of reference. And yet this point of reference is not necessarily apparent from the start;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must not wish for the disappearance of our troubles but the grace to transform them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every problem calls forth qualities from the hidden treasure within us. Accepting more responsibility and challenges brings a greater activation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>humility, gratitude, and love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our essential will and presence stand outside time and space, relatively free and pure. This presence is more ourselves than the impulses with which we might identify. Some people may argue that to go with every impulse is natural and spontaneous; on the contrary, this response represents the depths of conditioning and mechanicality. It is not free will, but slavery. Freedom lies in the altogether different direction of conscious will that frees us from habit, conditioning, and reactive behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret of transformation is the moment-by-moment alchemy of impulse. This may manifest itself as restraint in action and speech, as courtesy, self-discipline, generosity, subtlety, or patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Weakness leads to weakness, just as strength leads to strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An aim should be specific and attainable, and it should be consistent with the general aim of the Work, which is awakening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To work on awakening is to extract attention or awareness from the stream of events, to cultivate an awareness that includes events, thoughts, and feelings but is not totally absorbed or identified with them. It involves an intention above all to be actively receptive, to be alive with sensitivity and attention, not to be thoroughly identified with one’s conditioning. Our intention to be awake is helped by deciding to interrupt our unconsciousness by setting intentional alarms for ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more our sense of identity and well-being depends upon what we possess or what people think of us, the less we are aware of our own intrinsic worth and, consequently, the more we are enslaved to the fear of loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Presence provides space—spatial dimension around our experiences, both inner and outer. In a sense, what we really are is that spaciousness, even more than what fills the space. With this spaciousness we can allow transformation to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>intimacy for me is here in service.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A seeker would never offer fear as an excuse for anything. Fear is not accepted by one who has a quest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is God to be literally feared? In the Qur’an the word taqwa is often translated as “fear,” but it would be better translated as “vigilance,” “awe,” or “God consciousness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The lover has only one fear, and that is the fear of offending the Beloved (which includes harming other people). The fear of God frees the lover of all other fears. This is the only kind of fear appropriate for one who is courting the Truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stringency ultimately is in service to Mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Take refuge in My Mercy from My Wrath. Take refuge in Me from</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Presence allows us to open to the suffering of the world; compassion is being able to feel the world’s suffering without being drowned by it. Perhaps it is in accepting our servanthood, in opening to the suffering of the world, that we ourselves are further transformed and acquire the qualities of the Creative Power. Loving-kindness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“the Friend speaks to us in many forms. We are all beloved here, and we are all receptive to the Truth and so the Truth can easily express itself. Know that the ‘you’ who felt special last night and the ‘you’ who felt diminished tonight are neither real. Prostrate them before the inner Friend if you want to find wisdom and be free of judging yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever we think we are better than others or whenever we think, “I want,” we are thinking of ourselves in the wrong way. When we can think differently—“my family needs this, my body needs this, my work needs this, help me to meet these needs, help me to reflect your abundance”—we can open to the inflow of spiritual energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>True service is giving of ourselves, of what we naturally are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Presence is the empty center that attracts and manifests the qualities of Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The seeker [dervish or Sufi] stands at the threshold between freedom and slavery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Make all your cares into a single care and God will see to all your cares. Be mindful of Him and He will be at your side”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Work informs us that freedom is found in surrender, trust, and friendship with the One. This freedom grows as we discover the qualities of the Friend within ourselves: generosity, patience, acceptance, truthfulness, and courage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your Lord wants you to know that your calling him is his answer to you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What we contemplate we become.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It gives back to us what we give to it, only more</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What we love we will become</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TWO QUALITIES THAT ARE SAID to be necessary to worship and prayer are recollection and humility. We begin by recollecting ourselves and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We gather the whole of ourselves into a single sincere act, calling upon this slumbering spiritual essence within us</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If a human being consistently directs his attention, desire, will, thought, and feeling in the direction of Love, the Love thus realized becomes a vital power and capacity. When we do so, we are also preparing ourselves to remember this Love spontaneously at other times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Worship may include conscious breathing, chanting, singing, and movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we must be in a state of worship always and everywhere. In addition to the traditional forms and rituals of our great sacred traditions, worship may yet take forms that are entirely new and creative, for what is of Spirit is creative.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Love brings together what needs to be brought together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>service without presence is sleep, and if we are identified with service, if we expect thanks or some reward, it instead becomes a demand. It is good to do what is right and feel good about it. It is good to serve those whom we love. It is necessary to contribute to the general welfare through generous and public-spirited action. All of this is basic to a decent human life, but it is not yet at the level of spiritual practice. The service that is spiritual practice is beyond attraction and beyond the limited ego. This service depends on a shift of awareness. Through it we are lifted out of our egoism; in it we become motivated by unconditional love of the life around us. It is the Beloved loving through us and the Generous giving through us. Even anger and criticism can be welcomed when it is from the Beloved, while the help and praise of those who “serve” with arrogance or self-righteousness feels like poison to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any action without presence is mechanical, and any step outward requires a corresponding step inward. If we are to truly grow in service, we must simultaneously grow in presence. The more our inner faculties are engaged, the more service will come naturally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is worship? To realize Reality. What is the sacred law? To do no evil. What is Reality? Selflessness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remembering God is the beginning of remembering ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine yourself to be the spaciousness in the room you sit, instead of the object, your body. Then go within and be the spaciousness that sits within you, instead of the subtle objects, which are the thoughts and emotions of personal identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>new perceptions and beliefs can become another cloud over the true nature if they become concepts about how things ought to be. In time, as the phenomena fade, the mind and emotions can react with a sense of loss, and many old conditioned patterns may return.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>development of a flexible mind, not so set in its ways, and willing to surrender itself into the unknown. We must trust emptiness when we encounter it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a quality called transmission that is not about the movement of energy so much as the resonance of pure consciousness, from itself to itself. That is, the consciousness that knows itself in the teacher, also knows itself as the other, you. It makes no distinction. To be seen this way through the body of an apparent “other” puts one at the threshold of realization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your true Self, which doesn’t want anything, ever. It can enjoy whatever is available, but it has no demands! You have a choice, you can suffer the wanting, or you can be free. This is the essence of surrender, to let go of wanting, to let go of the me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>each movement of believing in thought is a movement away from the moment, where there is clarity and simple presence. When a condition is directly in front of you that obviously needs attention you are free to respond spontaneously and creatively.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to be very alert, or else your mind will play false with you. It is like watching a thief – not that you expect anything from a thief, but you do not want to be robbed. In the same way you give a lot of attention to the mind without expecting anything from it.” (Nisardagatta Maharaj (1994). I Am That, Acorn</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The key is always bringing what’s unconscious into consciousness. I suggest that people who have something they cannot get beyond go home and write down everything it believes until its exhausted itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To embody it is the practice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is best not to be attached to them, not to re-identify as the person with these skills, and to hold them lightly with wonder and gratitude rather than passion. If no “powers” emerge this is not a sign of a lack in your awakening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whatever he needs to know is there when he needs it, but not a moment before.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You simply become willing to live in the unknown, and listen to your deepest inclinations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whenever you see a great darkness, you can be certain at the core is a great light.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to know in our cells what it means, personally and individually, one by one, for the use of the Whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our purpose exists in the moment, rather than the future.</p>

    <title>Contemplative Prayer</title>

<h1 id="contemplative-prayer">Contemplative Prayer</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>necessary to use many words. Only</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the monk searches not only his own heart: he plunges deep into the heart of that world of which he remains a part although he seems to have “left” it. In reality the monk abandons the world only in order to listen more intently to the deepest and most neglected voices that proceed from its inner depth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the monk’s chief service to the world: this silence, this listening, this questioning, this humble and courageous exposure to what the world ignores about itself—both good and evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cannot fill a heart that has not previously been humbled and emptied by dread</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is not only a means to an end, but also has something of the nature of an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a wordless and total surrender of the heart in silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you love truth, be a lover of silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the sunlight will illuminate you in God and will deliver you from the phantoms of ignorance. Silence will unite you to God himself. … More</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than all things love silence: it brings you a fruit that tongue cannot describe. In the beginning we have to force ourselves to be silent. But then there is born something that draws us to silence. May God give you an experience of this “something” that is born of silence. If only you practice this, untold light will dawn on you in consequence … after a while a certain sweetness is born in the heart of this exercise and the body is drawn almost by force to remain in silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>conscious awareness of and dependence on God. Once again, the forms taken by this “awareness” are not defined or prescribed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of “the heart” might well be analyzed here. It refers to the deepest psychological ground of one’s personality, the inner sanctuary where self-awareness goes beyond analytical reflection and opens out into metaphysical and theological confrontation with the Abyss of the unknown yet present—one who is “more intimate to us than we are to ourselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in the Spirit of God we “see” God our Father without “seeing.” We know him in “unknowing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We should not, however, judge the value of our meditation by “how we feel.” A hard and apparently fruitless meditation may in fact be much more valuable than one that is easy, happy, enlightened and apparently a big success.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When one is simply obeying God, a little effort goes a long way. When one is in fact resisting him (though claiming to have no other intention than that of fulfilling his will) no amount of effort can produce a good result.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The only trouble is that in the spiritual life there are no tricks and no short cuts. Those who imagine that they can discover special gimmicks and put them to work for themselves usually ignore God’s will and his grace. They are self-confident and even self-complacent. They make up their minds that they are going to attain to this or that, and try to write their own ticket in the life of contemplation. They may even appear to succeed to some extent. But certain systems of spirituality—notably Zen Buddhism—place great stress on a severe, no-nonsense style of direction that makes short work of this kind of confidence. One cannot begin to face the real difficulties of the life of prayer and meditation unless one is first perfectly content to be a beginner and really experience himself as one who knows little or nothing, and has a desperate need to learn the bare rudiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who think they “know” from the beginning will never, in fact, come to know anything. People who try to pray and meditate above their proper level, who are too eager to reach what they believe to be “a high degree of prayer,” get away from the truth and from reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Acedia follows the enthusiasm of pride and spiritual vanity. A long course in humility and compunction is the remedy! We do not want to be beginners. But let us be convinced of the fact that we will never be anything else but beginners, all our life!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Meditation has no point and no reality unless it is firmly rooted in life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>more and more directed to an obedient and cooperative submission to grace, which implies first of all an increasingly attentive and receptive attitude toward the hidden action of the Holy Spirit. It is precisely the function of meditation, in the sense in which we speak of it here, to bring us to this attitude of awareness and receptivity. It also gives us strength and hope, along with a deep awareness of the value of interior silence in which the mystery of God’s love is made clear to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the prayer of the heart has to be always very simple, confined to the simplest of acts and often making use of no words and no thoughts at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>love on a simply human plane, it does so in order to fill them with a higher and purer light which is “darkness” to sense and to reason. The darkening is therefore at the same time an enlightenment. God darkens the mind only in order to give a more perfect light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the “dark night of faith,” one passes from meditation, in the sense of active “mental prayer,” to contemplation, or a deeper and simpler intuitive form of receptivity, in which, if one can be said to “meditate” at all, one does so only by receiving the light with passive and loving attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in every action we beg from God the success of our labors and satisfy our debt of gratitude to him … and when we keep before our minds the aim of pleasing him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God works in us while we rest in him. Beyond all grasping is this work of the Creator, itself creative, this rest. For such work exceeds all rest, in its tranquility. This rest, in its effect, shines forth as more productive than any work. Therefore let this action or rest of our contemplation be fashioned so as to reproduce, even though only in faint or sketchy lines, one model (of work and rest which is in God). …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We seek rather to gain a direct existential grasp, a personal experience of the deepest truths of life and faith, finding ourselves in God’s truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The dark night rectifies our deepest intentions. In the silence of this “night of faith” we return to simplicity and sincerity of heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Augustine’s words: Noverim te, noverim me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>purity of heart, an unconditional and totally humble surrender to God, a total acceptance of ourselves and of our situation as willed by him. It means the renunciation of all deluded images of ourselves, all exaggerated estimates of our own capacities, in order to obey God’s will as it comes to us in the difficult demands of life in its exacting truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>must use my freedom in order to love, with full responsibility and authenticity,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the “grace of meditation” (in the sense of “prayer of the heart”) is also a special gift. It should never be taken for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a permanent disposition to humility, attention to reality, receptivity, pliability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sacrifices that are not chosen are often of greater value than those we select for ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the terrible experience of being apparently without faith in order to really grow in faith. For it is this testing, this fire of purgation, that burns out the human and accidental elements of faith in order to liberate the deep spiritual power in the center of our being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just as the light that shows us all has no need of another light in order to be seen, so God, who shows us all things, has no need of a light in which we may see him, for he is himself light by essence,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only when we are able to “let go” of everything within us, all desire to see, to know, to taste and to experience the presence of God, do we truly become able to experience that presence with the overwhelming conviction and reality that revolutionize our entire inner life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for us the mystery contains, within its own darkness and its own silences, a presence and a meaning which we apprehend without fully understanding them.</p>

<h1 id="natural-liberation-padmasambhavas-teachings-on-the-six-bardos">Natural Liberation: Padmasambhava’s Teachings on the Six Bardos</h1>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>pondering the sufferings of the cycle of existence, (2) the difficulty of obtaining a human life of leisure and endowment, and (3) meditating on death and impermanence are the preliminary practices for subduing your own mind-stream. The preliminary practices for training your own mind-stream include: (4) guru yoga, (5) the hundred-syllable mantra, and finally (6) the spiritual activity of offering the maṇḍala.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of death, and bring your practice to its culmination.     There is no time to waste in life, and the circumstances that lead to death are beyond imagination.     Then if you fail to achieve the confidence of fearlessness,     What is the point of your being alive?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We should practice “until the experience of them arises</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Settling the mind in its natural state. In settling the mind in its natural state, there are also three parts: while keeping the body and speech as they were before, let your mind be lucid, without engaging any thoughts concerning earlier or later deceptive appearances of the three times; inwardly, settle the mind evenly without engaging in any good thoughts, such as deity meditation; secretly, settle the mind in its natural state by letting it be just as it is, steadily, clearly, and lucidly in the space in front of you, in the mind’s own mode of existence, without bringing to mind any of the mentally engaging thoughts of the view and meditation which entail mental grasping. Do that for three days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>place in front of you a small object such as a stick or pebble. Gaze at it steadily without closing your eyes, and at the same time place your attention upon it steadily, clearly, and lucidly, without being distracted by anything else. Do not strenuously thrust your attention at it. Vividly settle your awareness simply on the unwavering meditative support without succumbing to any ordinary distractions. Remain clear, gently release into a sense of comfort, and relax a bit. Meanwhile, rest the mind naturally, unwaveringly, and steadily upon that meditative support, without entering into the dispersal of thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rest your gaze simply so that you don’t lose your awareness of space.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s better to have as many sessions of short duration as we can throughout the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When bringing the session to a close, do not rise from it abruptly; rather, with a sense of conscientiousness, gently integrate it with your behavior and transform this into the path. Let all your conduct be like that of a person with a concussion who is afraid of getting bumped, and conscientiously lead your life in a meditative fashion. Do that for three days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Next, place your body in the proper posture and so on, like before. For your meditative object, vividly direct your attention simply, without wavering, to a white, radiant, clear, limpid bindu at the point between your eyebrows. About the size of a white pea, it appears but is without an inherent nature. Gently release in clarity and joy, and settle your mind in its natural state. Do not be interrupted by thoughts. Meditate just like that, with many sessions of short duration, as before. Engage in that meditation for three days or as your own experience dictates. Whatever experiences occur from time to time, examine them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gently recognize the thoughts. Even if you impede them, they will not stop. Without following after them, focus on the meditative object. By so doing, thoughts will become more and more subtle, and they will decrease in number.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each time a thought arises, recognize it immediately and release it so that it naturally vanishes. If two thoughts arise, recognize them. Do not follow after anything that appears, but let it arise and be released. At times, focus on the meditative object; and at times, let thoughts arise and vanish. While not fabricating anything in their wake, relax and release. By alternately practicing like that, the chain of compulsive ideation will become disconnected, and thoughts will become fragmented. Thus, detrimental thoughts will become fewer and fewer, and fine stability will arise. Meditate in that way for three days or as your experience dictates.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintaining the body in the posture bearing the seven attributes of Vairocana, let the spine be erect and straight, and press the hands against the ground. While so doing, completely exhale three times, once through the right nostril, once through the left, and once from the middle. Simultaneously imagine that sins and obscurations are purified, and that the sins are discharged from your nostrils in the form of scorpions and are then incinerated in the roaring flames of the fire of primordial wisdom in the space in front of you. This expels the toxins of the vital energies. Then together with your inhalation, while swallowing your saliva once, scrunch down beneath the navel; and without thinking of any meditative object, rest your awareness in clarity. When you can do so no more, completely exhale. Do that for three days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Expel the residual vital energy and position your body as before. Now when you inhale, imagine the physical blessings of all the buddhas of the three times being drawn in in the form of a white syllable OṂ. Then push the upper vital energy down, draw the lower vital energy up, and gather them together beneath the navel.         In the midst of the “closed amulet” of the upper and lower vital energies, imagine the essence of the speech of all the buddhas of the three times in the nature of a clear, empty, vivid red syllable ĀḤ, which appears but is without an inherent nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>vajra-recitations of the three syllables, so practice it continuously. Do that for three days, then do it constantly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>alternate between intense concentration and relaxation. There are various ways to maintain mindfulness throughout the day, one of which is constantly to sustain the awareness of space. Another way to maintain mindfulness is the vajra-recitation. Whatever technique you follow, it’s very important that between sessions you don’t discard the practice altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternate between observing who is concentrating inwardly and who is releasing. If it is the mind, ask, “What is that very agent that releases the mind and concentrates the mind?” Steadily observe yourself, and then release again. By so doing, fine stability will arise, and you may even identify awareness. Do that, too, for one day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the awareness itself steadily observe itself. At times, let your mind come to rest in the center of your heart, and evenly leave it there. At times, evenly focus it in the expanse of the sky and leave it there. Thus, by shifting the gaze in various, alternating ways, the mind settles in its natural state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this particular technique, you are indeed resting your awareness in the space in front; but your awareness must be imbued with the three qualities of mindfulness, introspection, and conscientiousness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if we’re following the Mahāyāna path and discern faults in others, then the appropriate response is compassion. If we’re following the Vajrayāna, engaging in the stages of generation and completion, then we must cultivate a pure view, seeing others in their divine aspects. In this case, others’ faults are not an issue, for this pure view saturates our entire awareness of the world. Furthermore, if we’re engaging in the practice of Atiyoga, our view is beyond the parameters of pure and impure. With this view, we experience an equality, or “equal taste,” of all phenomena. The very notions of purity and impurity don’t even arise. In terms of faults then, we should point to ourselves, for finding fault in others is our own disgrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognize your faults and let them be perfectly obvious to yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>practice with a powerful sense that daytime appearances are dreams. Even the least of practitioners will apprehend the dream-state within one month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon as novices recognize, “This is a dream!” they wake up and there is dispersal of that recognition.43 To dispel that, maintain your attention at the level of the heart</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To transform the fruit into the path, you practice without hope of accomplishing anything and without fear of not accomplishing anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First practice in short sessions, and as you become accustomed to it, practice in longer and longer sessions. When you bring the session to an end, do not get up abruptly, but rise slowly without losing the sense of meditating; and proceed without losing the sense of awareness, without wavering, and without grasping. As you eat, drink, speak, and engage in every activity, do so without losing the sentry of unwavering mindfulness. If this happens in meditative equipoise but not afterwards, by integrating this with your spiritual practice and all activities of moving, walking, lying down, and sitting, whatever you do will appear as meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without any manner of placing awareness anywhere, letting it be in its own state, without modification, is meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>too much effort and tension in your practice can create problems. You’re straining hard, trying to hold onto the object, which appears to be unstable. To counteract such excessive tension, lighten up. Ease up a bit in the meditation. Let your mind be more spacious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to being free of the craving of samādhi is to release grasping. The best student is an “instantaneous person” who gains realization as soon as the nature of awareness is pointed out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your actions do have karmic consequences. It’s important to be extremely conscientious about the nature of our activities. Like the first person in the story, we need to be conscientious about our actions. It’s important that we do practice; it’s important that we do cultivate compassion; and it’s very important that we do not make a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t try to cover up unpleasant subjects, face them. That’s the best response.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mentally offer everything that you have, including not only your material possessions, but also your relatives and everyone around you. Release attachment for everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>lying on your right side the vital energies will move from the left nostril.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have nothing physical to offer or no altar to put it on, this is no problem. Offer your body, speech, and mind and don’t be upset. That’s fine. This option of simply offering your body, speech, and mind is a good one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I am to die suddenly, I must focus on the crown of my head.” This resolve is of essential importance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to know the meaning of the object of your reverence and to be familiar with the excellent qualities of the objects of refuge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Start with many short sessions, then gradually increase the duration of each one, and decrease the number of sessions per day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>attachment, aversion, and delusion are to be banished, like a poisonous snake. Especially the poison of attachment is to be eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether for hearing, thinking, or meditation, the motivation is paramount.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by training in regarding all appearances as being like reflections in a mirror, appearing and yet devoid of an inherent nature, such that appearances and emptiness are indivisible, the deceptive appearances of the daytime will arise as pure visions. Due to that, one is free from clinging onto the true existence of dreams, and one either recognizes the dream-state as the dream-state, or it arises as the clear light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>illusory nature of everything you experience. Becoming accustomed to that during the daytime places imprints upon your mind-stream; and these carry over into the dream-state, so this pure vision also occurs at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These companions I meet today and this evening, relatives, and fellow travelers have also died and are wandering with me in the transitional process. They are not truly existent, and like a dream and an illusion, they have no objective existence, or true existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Resting the mind in its unstructured, originally pure state means that you do not follow after any thoughts that arise, be they virtuous or nonvirtuous. Thus, whatever comes up in the mind, you let it come up and let it be without reacting to it, without classifying it, and without responding to it or trying to modify it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever comes up, don’t block it. As soon as you try to block it, you’ve lost the nature of it; and you’re no longer doing this practice. If you feel that you must do something to make the thoughts go away, you’re not doing the practice. If you feel you need to sustain these mental events, again you’re not doing the practice. The practice here is to allow awareness to rest in its own natural state, originally pure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this meditation is to cultivate the constant awareness, day and night, of the lack of true existence of phenomena. In this way, we recognize the manner in which we are normally confused by our grasping onto the true existence of phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most practical avenue is to implement these teachings as much as you can right now in your daily life. Let your practice flow into the present, rather than anticipating some future situation that you consider more ideal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One may be ambitious, energetic, and hard-working in a worldly sense; but, from a Dharma perspective, that person who is working eighteen hours a day is said to be lazy. We are just part of the crowd if we show such stupidity as to waste this opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not sleep like an animal,     But practice integrating sleep and direct perception!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The great thing about this practice is that you can sleep and practice at the same time, and in that way gain realization of the clear light. During the daytime, we have the opportunity to engage in hearing, thinking, and meditation and to experience the fruition of the path. And at nighttime, we have the opportunity to hear teachings, ponder them, and put them into practice through the night to gain the fruition of the practice while we’re sleeping.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To enter into the experience that is free of extremes, we must be free of the extremes of nihilism and eternalism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is best to recognize your own nature. Then you will not need somebody else to liberate you from fictitious problems.</p>

<h1 id="wonders-of-the-natural-mind-the-essence-of-dzogchen-in-the-native-bon-tradition-of-tibet">Wonders of the Natural Mind: The Essence of Dzogchen in the Native Bon Tradition of Tibet</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The outer cycle is the path of renunciation (spong lain), the Sutra teachings. The inner cycle is the path of transformation (sgyur lam), the Tantric teachings, which use mantras. The secret cycle is the path of self-liberation (grol lam), the Dzogchen teachings. This division into Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen (mdo sngags sems gsum) is also found in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-arising wisdom is the base. The five negative emotions are manifested energy. Seeing emotions as mistaken is an error. Letting them be in their nature is the method To find the non-dual state of Liberation. Overcoming hope and fear is the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tapihritsa is depicted in Dharmakaya form, like Kuntuzangpo, naked and without ornaments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The view is my master. I practice the nonconceptual state. I meditate on everything I see in the three dimensions (of existence). I am carrying thoughts in my bag. My behavior is to work as the servant of sentient beings. I am going nowhere.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Human or animal, in order to bring the cycle of samsara to an end, we must discover the source of suffering. This is the thinking mind that gives rise to the passions and to attachment. The only way to overcome the poisons of the five passions and their manifestations is to bring the mind under control. This can be done through practicing the teachings that bid us to observe ourselves in order to understand and, through practice, overcome our grasping mind. In this way the teachings guide us to know the underlying nature of the mind and integrate its true condition with our daily life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Defilements, or obscurations, are not in the nature of the mind (sems nyid) but in the moving mind (sems), so they can be purified.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we realize our innate purity but only integrate with it from time to time, we are not totally realized. Being in total integration all the time is final realization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>even though it is a quality that is innate, we have to develop it. The traditional analogy is to the way the quality of butter already exists in milk: to get the butter we have to chum the milk.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main point to bear in mind in relation to meditation is to avoid indulging in spiritual fantasies and to remember that the fundamental purpose of the practice is to acquire, maintain, and develop continuity of presence of awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there is nothing spoken about in the teachings that we cannot find in ourselves, in our own experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>all that there really is left to do is to sit quietly;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Effort and commitment to practice are necessary. No obstacle that arises in zhine practice, such as laziness or mental agitation, should divert us and no kind of daily activity should distract us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we start to meditate, it is best to alternate short sessions of formal practice with rest periods, gradually increasing the duration of the sessions as we become more accustomed to relaxing in the calm state of mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepare a piece of indigo paper one inch square with the Tibetan letter A drawn as illustrated on page 89. The A should be enclosed in five concentric, colored circles. The central circle should be indigo. This should be surrounded by green, red, yellow, and white in that order. (If one feels uncomfortable with the Tibetan letter, an English “A” can be used in its place.) Place the paper on a stick high enough so that the square can rest about one and one half feet in front of your nose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We must not blink the eyes or inhibit the flowing of “the three waters”: saliva from the mouth, mucus from the nose, and tears from the eyes. These must be allowed to flow freely, because we must concentrate and not allow these reflex actions to distract us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we should concentrate as if we were putting a thread into the eye of a needle. As regards the mind, we should neither think of the past nor the future, nor should we try to change the present situation. We must simply maintain presence of awareness of the A, but without thinking about the A, and concentrate as intensely as possible. We must not lose awareness of the A even for a second. It is important to distinguish between simply maintaining presence of awareness of the A, that is, directing the attention continuously to the A without the stream of attention being distracted, and actively thinking about the A, which is merely creating another thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thoughts cannot be liberated by other thoughts: “good” thoughts cannot liberate “bad” thoughts, just as blood cannot wash away blood from a hand. “Good” and “bad” thoughts are both obstacles to direct understanding of the natural state, which is beyond thought, and thought cannot understand what is beyond thought. Understanding of the natural state can only be direct understanding not mediated by thought; it is the empty nature of the mind understanding itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thoughts are the movement of the mind and are of the same nature as the natural mind, just as waves are of the same watery nature as the sea. When thoughts arise during the state of contemplation, we are aware that they arise from emptiness and that their essence is of the nature of emptiness. We are not disturbed by them but let them go, remaining in the equanimity of contemplation. In this way the natural state of emptiness becomes clearer:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is important for us is to reach the condition in which we are no longer distracted or disturbed by thoughts. This is not a blank state in which thoughts are absent. In fact, the cultivation of the calm state without thoughts, if prolonged beyond the natural gap that exists between two thoughts, becomes a state of ignorance, not of presence, if in the forced absence of thoughts there is only emptiness without clarity, relaxation without presence. In the true state of contemplation we are relaxed and neither create nor block thoughts but remain present without distraction in the mind-moments of both presence and absence of thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we are present, we suffer just as all people suffer, but our way of suffering is different and the result is different, because although we have problems and suffering, these cannot distract us from presence in the natural state;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dzogchen practitioners it is very important to work with presence, to develop it well and then to integrate it with our actions of body, voice, and mind in order to have total presence. But what is “total presence”? It is the continuity of presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we see with our eyes in the state of contemplation what we are really seeing is our own wisdom. The eyes are the portals of wisdom according to Bon Dzogchen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>once we have stabilized our contemplation, it is important not only to remain in tranquility but also to “practice with the movements of energy of secondary causes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is important to try to remain in the state of presence and overcome the subtle dualistic division between contemplation and everyday life, between thun and je thob, between formal practice sessions and “after practice,” and to integrate presence and contemplation with daily life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Integration means the coordination of presence with the movement of energy and consists of the application of the pure wisdom of contemplation to our senses, to our body, voice, mind, and actions in every moment of our life by remaining present in the primordial state and imbuing all the activities of body, voice, and mind in daily life with awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonpo Ati system of Dzogchen meditation, where the disciple is told to integrate first with virtuous actions, then neutral actions and finally nonvirtuous actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtuous actions are those that do not distract us from the state of presence and that accumulate merit; nonvirtuous actions are those motivated by the five passions and that accumulate obstacles to spiritual development; neutral actions are those that have no karmic consequences and thus accumulate neither merit nor obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially we try to integrate the state of contemplation with activities of the body, which are easiest, then with activities of speech, and finally with activities of the mind, which are the most difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the point of integrating with negative states is not to justify wrong action. It is, rather, the best way to minimize harm and, ultimately, to overcome negativity. If we all mastered the practice of integration, there would be no harm or injury since we would all be in the non-dual state and when we are in the non-dual state we cannot cause harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>five poisons. These are: attachment to people and to things; anger, which can manifest when simply seeing someone gives rise to an unpleasant sensation; pride, which can manifest not only by thinking oneself to be very important but also by thinking one is the worst kind of person; jealousy, which means all kinds of comparisons and competition; and ignorance, which means not understanding the real condition. So in relation to the mind we start by trying to integrate with virtuous actions, then gradually pass to neutral actions, and finally to the five poisons. In this way, the whole mind, all thoughts - good, bad, and neutral - are integrated with the state of presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is not the number of thoughts that arise that is important, but how we deal with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is actually only one way to deal with them, and that is not to be distracted by them. This can be done in three ways: by remaining in presence; by not following after them or creating more thoughts (such as the thought not to follow them); and by not allowing them to influence us (in this case it is not a matter of not following the thoughts but of not allowing the thoughts themselves to lead us away).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is easier to discover and realize self-presence through sense perception that is fresh and immediate than through thought that elaborates perception by conceptualization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is more presence with greater sensation, there is more feeling of integration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your mind does make a judgment, do not grasp it as inherently existent; if you do grasp it, do not develop it into a gross passion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the application of practice in daily life that is most difficult, working with our energy in every life situation, with every sense perception, with every person we meet, whether we</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is of great importance to have experiential, and not merely conceptual,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional example is of a farmer that looks for a yak and cannot find it: what he finds is “no yak.” When we search for a “self” and do not find one, what we find is “no self”; this means finding our true self.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes symbols can be much more effective than clarification through intellectual descriptions because, although we learn through intellectual descriptions, we grow through symbols;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do anything without any indecision or hesitation. Without expectations or doubts All actions are completely free. Behavior becomes like a peacock’s, Taking all negative obstacles and appearances as blessings. When unhappy, abide completely in unhappiness; When happy, abide completely in happiness; When ill, abide completely in illness; When hungry, abide completely in hunger; When afraid, abide completely in fear; When you don’t like something, abide completely in the state of not liking. This is the big wind. When vision is an obstacle, be careful; When vision becomes your friend, liberate yourself. Then everything becomes a benefit to your practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the five pure lights develop and begin to appear. This process is represented by the five-colored tigle that surrounds the white A and which symbolizes the primordial natural condition. The pure lights of the five colors constitute the second step in the production of existence; they are the source of the five elements that are the underlying structure of both the external existence of the world and the internal existence of the individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>clear light energy resides in the heart, rises through the channels, and is projected through the eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>observing anger and seeing its inherent emptiness is the antidote to anger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when anger arises, we can see the anger in ourselves, but when we try to examine it closely, we only find the inherent emptiness of anger,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific togel practices include the dark retreat in which we spend time practicing in complete darkness (the standard dark retreat lasts forty-nine days, although some Dzogchen practitioners have spent many years in dark retreat), or gazing at the sun, at the moon, or into the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>everything is connected: external vision, the eyes, and the internal energy,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we have to discard as dualistic even the idea of practice and non-practice. We enter into the meditation of inner space and abandon this subtle dualistic concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>light that can transform itself into material objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>effortless spontaneity of remaining in presence in undistracted meditation. If no effort of concentration is required, this means there is no distraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dharmakaya is emptiness; the Sambhogakaya is light and the internal manifestation of energy; the Nirmanakaya is the external manifestation of the energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dzogchen, in contrast, is a nongradual path, and from the very beginning the master teaches the practitioner to seek to understand emptiness directly without thought, through zhine practice. Through the application of mind beyond thought and concepts, we achieve undistracted presence and understanding of the inseparability of emptiness and clarity. The understanding of emptiness arises without the mediation of the thought-producing mind but directly by clarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Dzogchen, the best way of understanding emptiness is not by applying thought, because the understanding obtained in this way can never go beyond the conceptual level. The logical mind comes to understand the logical concept of emptiness, but the truth of emptiness is beyond thought and concept, beyond the logical mind. True emptiness cannot be understood by logical inference because thought, the conceptual mind, can only understand the concept or meaning generality of emptiness and cannot directly perceive emptiness itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are able to maintain continuity of presence during our waking hours, we will eventually be able to maintain it through the moment of falling asleep and into our dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Dzogchen there is no beginning to samsara as such, but there is a beginning to individual samsara. The beginning of samsara is caused by ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We must not only recognize that we are dreaming, but realize presence in the dream. Many people who don’t follow teachings also recognize when they are dreaming, but in our practice what we must do is to remain present and eventually direct and control the dream ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As mind’s last moment is the most important,</p>

<h1 id="the-tibetan-yogas-of-dream-and-sleep">The Tibetan Yogas Of Dream And Sleep</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>When things are seen from a higher perspective they tend to level out. From the perspective of non-dual wisdom there is no important and unimportant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not think about the object, just let it be in awareness. This is an important distinction to make. Thinking about the object is not the kind of concentration we are developing. The point is just to keep the mind placed on the object, on the sense perception of the object, to undistractedly remain aware of the presence of the object. When the mind does get distracted—and it often will in the beginning—gently bring it back to the object and leave it there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thoughts arise without distracting the mind from the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may find that drowsiness is actually a kind of movement of the mind that you can stop with strong concentration. If this does not work, take a break, stretch, and perhaps do some practice while standing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regard the practice as something precious, which it is, and as something that will lead to the attainment of the highest realization, which it will. Strengthen the intention and automatically the wakefulness of the mind is strengthened.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is not enough to simply repeat again and again that you are in a dream. The truth of the statement must be felt and experienced beyond the words. Use the imagination, senses, and awareness in fully integrating the practice with felt experience. When you do the practice properly, each time you think that you are in a dream, presence becomes stronger and experience more vivid.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the first preparation, to see all life as a dream. It is to be applied in the moment of perception and before a reaction arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the first preparation is applied in the moment of encountering phenomena and before a reaction occurs, the second practice is engaged after a reaction has arisen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a reaction arises, remind yourself that you, the object, and your reaction to the object are all dream. Think to yourself, “This anger is a dream. This desire is a dream. This indignation, grief, exuberance, is a dream.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>try to actually feel the dream-like quality of your inner life. When this assertion is actually felt, not just thought, the relationship to the situation changes, and the tight, emotional grip on phenomena relaxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The third preparation involves reviewing the day before going to sleep, and strengthening the intention to practice during the night. As you prepare for sleep, allow the memories of the day to arise. Whatever comes to mind recognize as a dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then develop the strong determination to recognize the dreams of the night for what they are. Make the strongest intention possible to know directly and vividly, while dreaming, that you are dreaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“sending a wish.” We should have that sense here,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep building intention, using both successes and failures as occasions to develop ever stronger intent to accomplish the practice. And know that even your intention is a dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>during the morning period, generate a strong intention to remain consistent in the practice throughout the day</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And pray with your full heart for success; prayer is like a magical power that we all have and forget to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mother Tantra tells us that as we prepare for sleep we should maintain awareness of the causes of dream, the object to focus upon, the protectors, and of ourselves. Hold these together in awareness, not as many things, but as a single environment,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>imaginal senses: try to visualize it clearly and, even more importantly, feel it and let it affect the sensations in the body and energy, and the quality of the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the object appear without effort, as if intention, lying below the surface of consciousness, binds the mind to the object, just as the mind stays connected to the need to wake for an early appointment or to a great joy. There is no need for exertion or concentration—the object just is and you are with it. You are no longer creating it, you are allowing it, observing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The progression is to see it, feel it, and then be it. When you fully merge with the object, the visualization may cease, and this is all right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not think this through—experience it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>anything that you cannot do, do not worry about. This is an important secret of practice! Worrying will not help your practice. But you also should not lose the force of your intention to do better. Just do the best you can.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The categories are: size; quantity; quality; speed; accomplishment; transformation; emanation; journey; seeing; encounter; and experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>syllables are RA, which is yellow and is toward the front of your body. LA, which is green, is to your left. SHA, to the back, is red. And SA is to the right and is blue. If there is a problem with restless self-distraction, focus on the syllables one after the other as you fall asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you find it difficult to calm the mind, it is sometimes helpful to do hard physical work, to tire the body or even exhaust it. Meditating on emptiness can also clear the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Meaning does not exist until someone starts to look for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why expect great messages from a dream? Instead penetrate to what is below meaning, the pure base of experience. This is the higher dream practice—not psychological, but more spiritual—concerned with recognizing and realizing the fundament of experience, the unconditioned. When you progress to this point, you are unaffected by whether there is a message in the dream or not. Then you are complete, your experience is complete, you are free from the conditioning that arises from dualistic interactions with the projections of your own mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>simple and regular habits of reconnecting to ourselves, of becoming more present, must be cultivated. Every breath can be a practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Appreciation for sensory experience reconnects mind and body.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>using bodily sensual experience to bring us to presence, to connect us to the beauty of the world, to the vivid and nourishing experience of life that lies under our distractions. This is the underpinning of successful dream yoga.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“May I have a clear dream. May I have a lucid dream. May I understand myself through dream.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel the A rather than focus on it, merge with it rather than remain separate from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four successive domains of integration related to dream practice: vision, dream, bardo, and clear light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>truth is that there is never an object separate from a subject; there is only an illusion of separation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dzogchen teachings always stress the importance of knowing yourself, recognizing your capacities and obstacles, and using that knowledge to practice in the manner that will be most beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bring the mind into rigpa if possible. If not, then bring the mind into the body, into the central channel, into the heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>strong intention is the foundation of the practice. Developing devotion will aid in making intention one-pointed and powerful enough to pierce the clouds of ignorance that mask the luminosity of the clear light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than relying on conceptual decisions to move from one tiglé to the next, and rather than trying to make the process happen, allow intention to unfold the process in experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleep yoga is not only a practice for sleep. It is the practice of remaining in non-dual awareness continually, throughout the four states of waking, sleeping, meditation, and death. Thus, the obstacles addressed below are actually the single obstacle of being driven away from the clear light and into dualistic, samsaric experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>prayer has power but it is not in the words; it is in the feeling you put in the prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The practice begins with light and the perceiver of light, but the intent is to unify the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is good to see the light of the tiglé but more important to feel it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience still arises, but allow whatever arises to dissolve spontaneously in blue light. Let this happen without effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mind plays tricks. Its main trick is to identify itself as the subject and then take everything else to be separate from that subject. In this practice, everything perceived as outside of yourself is dissolved on the exhalation. The perceiver is dissolved on the inhalation. Both outside and inside become luminous and clear and merge into one another, becoming indistinguishable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Life needs to take some form; if we do not shape it, it will take a form dictated by karma, which we may not like very much.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we directly observe desire rather than becoming fixated on the object of desire, the desire dissolves. And if we can abide in pure presence, the desire, the desiring subject, and the object of desire will all dissolve into their empty essence, revealing the clear light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When pleasure is used as a door to practice, the pleasure is not lost; we need not be anti-pleasure. When the subject and object dissolve in clear light, then the union of emptiness and clarity is experienced and there is joy. The approach to hatred or aversion is similar. If we observe anger rather than participating in it or identifying with it or being driven by it, then the dualistic obsession with the object of anger ceases and the anger dissolves into emptiness. If presence is maintained in that emptiness, then the subject, too, dissolves. The presence in that empty space is the clear light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more wisdom is present, the less thoughts there will be.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wake, if possible, in the nature of mind rather than in the conventional mind. Observe without identifying with the observer. This can be a little easier in the first moments of waking because the conceptual mind is not totally awake yet. Develop the intention to wake in pure presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The distraction of our daily life and the unconsciousness of sleep are two faces of the same ignorance. The only limits to practice are those we create. It is best not to compartmentalize practice into periods of meditating, dreaming, sleeping, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dzogchen teachings often use a mirror to symbolize rigpa. A mirror reflects everything without choice, preference, or judgement. It reflects the beautiful and the ugly, the big and the small, the virtuous and the non-virtuous. There are no limits or restrictions on what it can reflect, yet the mirror is unstained and unaffected by whatever is reflected in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn the form, understand the purpose of it, apply it in practice, and realize the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So take joy and peace as qualities to maintain, as supports in developing the continuity of awareness. Feel these qualities in the body, see them in the world, and wish them for others.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuity is the key to integrating life and practice. With awareness and intention, continuity can be developed.</p>

<h1 id="stilling-the-mind-shamatha-teachings-from-dudjom-lingpas-vajra-essence">Stilling the Mind: Shamatha Teachings from Dudjom Lingpa’s Vajra Essence</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The practice of Dzogchen brings one into direct contact with reality, unmediated by the individual personality or society.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Düdjom Lingpa was a lay practitioner, married, and the father of eight renowned sons,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the specific approach of taking appearances and awareness as the path, also known as settling the mind in its natural state. In brief, this consists of observing all arising mental phenomena without grasping on to them. Your thoughts, emotions, images, and so forth are observed closely with mindfulness, but you do not encourage, discourage, or involve yourself in any way with the arising mental phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true value of the Dharma is as a vehicle to the enlightened state in order to be of greatest benefit in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the transmission of Dzogchen can be mind to mind, it can be symbolic, or it can be verbal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>developing our own discerning wisdom, our own discerning intelligence</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Three Roots are the lama (or spiritual mentor), your yidam (or personal deity—Tara, Padmasambhava, Manjushri, or whomever it may be), and the dakini (the enlightened feminine principle).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to grasp at a thought? What is the nature of grasping? The Sanskrit graha means “to hold on to,” “to grasp.” It’s exactly that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>anything believed to exist by itself is a product of reification. This reification is the root of samsara, the cycle of existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by designating it as a cup you are not necessarily reifying it by grasping on to it as inherently real. It is possible to use language without being trapped by it, although generally we are unable to avoid it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>William James: “For the moment, what we attend to is reality.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in the vastness of space attending to it, and remain there with your eyes open—very important, your eyes open—and simply maintain presence in space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is important to keep your eyes open and not grasp, not become attached to the phenomena that appear to your visual perception.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So gaze into the space in front of you and notice that there is no big deal here; let this be utterly ordinary. Don’t think you are doing anything special, because you are not. There’s the space in front of you. Just be present with it, that is, attend to it, notice it. Avoid involving yourself with details, such as labeling: “There’s a cushion. It’s on a red rug. The cushion is soft. The rug is hard.” If you slip into grasping like that, you’ve diminished the spaciousness of your meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a general rule of thumb when internal distractions arise in your meditation: Should your mind become excited, cast your gaze downward. If the mind loses energy or clarity—becomes dull, lax—then elevate your gaze. This advice also applies to visualization, as when you visualize a deity. In that case, when you feel dull you raise the imagined image, and when excitement disturbs your tranquility you lower it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you are still in the early stages of shamatha you might want to try this out. Choose something you would enjoy looking at for twenty-four minutes. Twenty-four-minute periods, or ghatikas, are recommended when you are just starting out in meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When discursive thoughts arise, let them go and return not only your visual gaze but your attention, your mental awareness, to the object. Continue like that for a week.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you can imagine one quite small, that’s great, but the size of a pea would be sufficient—something fairly small and round. It’s glistening with five colors—white, yellow, red, green, and blue—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This practice of taking the mind as the path is a method for becoming lucid during the waking state with respect to the flow of thoughts. We recognize them for what they are—like becoming lucid in a dream—and in so doing, we break the chain of obsessions, compulsion, and delusion. Here is a direct path to freedom, which leads to greater and greater freedom both while awake and while asleep, and this freedom may lead to the infinitely greater freedom from samsara as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>by not engaging with them, thoughts will usually, over time, thin out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t grasp, the mind will self-heal and dissolve into its ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are grasping, though, you are not doing this practice. Certainly to grasp on to such appearances would be enormously tempting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In any of these cases if you grasp, you are not doing the practice. The practice is not grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Settle your mind without distraction, without grasping.” If you are doing that while focusing single-pointedly on the space of the mind and its contents, that’s pretty much it. If you’re letting yourself be carried away, that implies distraction, so do your best to maintain unwavering mindfulness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when a mental image of delicious food arises, if you get carried away, thinking about enjoying such a treat, you’ve been caught up in distraction and grasping. If you focus on the mental image of the food, and you are holding on to it because you’re attracted to it, that’s grasping. If you are simply mindful of that image, without being drawn to it and without wanting it to go away, you are practicing correctly. When you feel attracted to a thought or image or even an emotion, you might tell yourself, “I’m not distracted; I’m right here, right in the moment. I really like this.” That too is grasping. So just be present, letting your awareness remain as still and as accommodating as space. It is very important to know clearly from moment to moment if you are practicing correctly or incorrectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply continue practicing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Having said that, in this practice, like in any other shamatha practice, there is a balance of neither falling into laxity nor being caught up in excitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when you’re meditating, you’re doing so with too much desire. When you’re practicing, don’t desire anything at all. Just do the practice—with no hopes and fears.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Between sessions, bring to mind all the aspirations and prayers you like. But when you are practicing, just do the practice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>make sure you also practice when you’re lying down.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when you’re doing this practice right, without grasping, even if a thousand maras rose up to attack you, whatever your maras are, they could not inflict any injury if you’re not grasping. And even if a thousand buddhas appeared to you, they couldn’t do you any good. They don’t need to. You don’t need anything from those thousands of images of buddhas. Just continue practicing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doing your best” is not “trying your hardest.” Given the balance of relaxation, stability, and vividness required, trying your hardest is trying way too hard. So in the course of the practice of shamatha, whatever technique you are following, the degree of effort you need to exert to practice correctly tapers off as you approach accomplishment, and then simply vanishes. You will have far greater stability and vividness than you started off with, but the effort to maintain and establish that vivid, steady apprehension vanishes of its own accord. “Such effort”—trying too hard—“makes the dissatisfied mind compulsively strive after mental objects.” You arrive at a point in the practice where, if you keep on exerting effort, keep on applying introspection to try to fix something, you’re actually cluttering up your practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you shouldn’t expect your thoughts to vanish. What you could hope for would be to maintain your presence with them, without distraction, without grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On merely hearing about depression, or a blank, nameless dread, or apparitions coming up, or nightmares or insomnias, or crushing boulders, or terrible pain throughout your body, we might smile and say, “Gee, that sounds pretty awful.” When it starts happening to us, however, we may easily grasp at and reify it—not because we want to but because it seems overwhelming. The same goes for the more pleasant kinds of nyam</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“from now until your realization of rigpa, everything is nyam.” From the ordinary, or relative, point of view, we must practice in order to purify our minds of our personal, karmic influences, which often find expression as nyam.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>with every arising challenge, if it’s insomnia, great! Let your awareness become larger than the mental space occupied by insomnia. If it’s paranoia, let your awareness be larger than the paranoia. If it’s bodily pain, make your awareness bigger than that. Each time you do that you will discover that you are not just surmounting an obstacle, but that a transformation is taking place that was necessary for you to go further in your practice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love for God is expressed and demonstrated through love for other people and for all of creation. You must burn with love like a candle. Its nature is to burn down, slowly dwindling away towards death but giving off so much light. Wherever it is, in whatever environment or surroundings, the candle gives off light. Whether in a mosque or temple, the candle burns and gives others light. That is the way you must be. When you are no longer a slave to your five senses, you perceive God in every thing, behind every phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Sufi meditation, techniques should never be separated from their philosophical framework and devotional basis. Without love, these meditation techniques are merely rote behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>these meditation practices and why the texts insist that they be practiced with and through the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to find God, then look within. And one looks within by meditating on the presence of God, thereby clearing from one’s vision everything other than God. This is the way of meditation that Sufi mystics taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kalimi order, who by belonging to the Kalimi order share initiation into the Chishti, Qadiri, Suhrawardi and Naqshbandi orders together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Qalandars believed in a simple life of owning little and desiring less in order to be free of social constraints and religious formalism. They abandoned the practice of meditation or contemplation, and sought to realize God through opposing the self-righteous and enjoying simplicity, poverty and hallucinogenic substances.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>seekers should resolve to stay engaged in meditation (zikr) and contemplation (fikr) and intimacy (uns).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are many types of meditation. One type is meditation of the tongue (lisan), and it needs no further explanation, as one repeats vocally a name of God or a phrase. Another type is meditation of the heart (qalb), which means purifying the heart of selfish desires and fiendish temptations in order that it remember God in truth. A third type is meditation of the inner heart (sirr), which fills the inner heart such that momentary stray thoughts which give rise to desires have no way to fix themselves in the heart. Meditation of the inner heart is the outcome of meditation of the heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>everything said, everything done and everything felt can be meditation, on condition that it leads them to remember God and stay awake and aware. Anything which does not promote remembering is forgetfulness and should be shunned,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am with you, my daily work is prayer And without you, my prayer is merely work</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>keep doing silent meditation. In this way, the seeker can rid the mind of the imprint of anything other than God, to assert the absolute oneness of God and turn towards God seeking presence (huzur) and intimacy (uns). The seeker should seek effacement (fana’) and obliteration in the holy divine presence. Realizing the truth of God means embracing the experience of being annihilated (tams) and erased (tals). This path is the quickest way to gain closeness to God and the surest way to achieve union.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>concentrate on the only really existing thing (God).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After meditation is completed, there are three rules to follow. One should maintain silence for some time after meditation. One should practice suspending the breath (as discussed in detail in Morsel 12). One should avoid the use of cold things like water or exposure to cool air, for these might dissipate the heat in the heart that is built up by meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who does extensive amounts of meditation but does not feel an expanded intimacy with God is doing it in vain;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bewilderment is a compound of two things, namely knowledge of the thing’s existence and ignorance of its nature. In contrast, doubt is a state of hesitation between knowledge and ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The present moment is as swift as a sword and brilliant as lightning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only real knowledge is knowing you can never really know.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet not knowing about a thing does not necessitate not being able to experience its existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>devotional exercise (shughl), meditative remembrance (zikr) and contemplative reflection (fikr)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>successful depends upon the aspiration of the disciple who uses them, and having a high aspiration entails no learning or exertion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh my Lord, lead me to one of your intimate servants that he may guide me to you and teach me the way to reach you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Drawing out” (madd) refers to prolonging the pronunciation of the first “a” in la ilaha or “no god.” “Intensifying” (shadd) refers to accentuating the first syllable “i” when saying illa ’llah or “but God.” “Below” (taht) refers to pronouncing la ilaha beginning by facing down towards the left knee and then raising the head up towards the right shoulder. Finally, “above” (fauq) means pausing for a while holding the breath before pronouncing illa ’llah or “but God” from above down onto the heart with great force.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the outset one should be instructed to say la ilaha illa ’llah in the sense of there is “no god but God.” Then the meditation should be performed with the understanding that there is “no object of worship but God” (la ma‵bud illa ’llah). Then it should be performed with the understanding that there is “no goal but God” (la maqsud illa ’llah). Then it should be performed with the understanding that there is “no desire but God” (la matlub illa ’llah). Finally, it should be performed with the understanding that there is “no being but God” (la mawjud illa ’llah).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The secret of the zikr lies in the fact that the sphere of hearing is less than that of seeing, and the sphere of seeing is less than that of knowing. The seeker begins in a state of reasoning about what is sensed (‵aql o shahadat), the narrowest of all spiritual states. As the seeker moves beyond the attribute sami‵ or “hears,” he progresses spiritually to a more comprehensive state of understanding what is beyond sensation (ghayb). As the seeker moves beyond the attribute basir or “sees,” he progresses spiritually to a more comprehensive state of understanding beyond the beyond (ghayb al-ghayb). As the seeker moves through the attribute ‵alim or “knows,” he comprehends this most expansive spiritual state. Then the seeker comes back through these attributes in the inverse order.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>big toe of the right foot and its neighboring toe, compress the sciatic nerve behind the left knee. Then draw in the abdomen around the navel towards the back, from below until above. Then close the eyes and call to the imagination the image of one’s spiritual guide (barzakh).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“All is with you, all is from you, all is to you, oh all of all!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh God, you are all, and from you is all, and with you is all, and for you is all, and to you is all, oh all of all”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One should focus one’s full concentration upon the heart, such that all one’s sensory awareness becomes unified in one direction and upon one object. There can be no doubt that when this state is achieved, self-absence and un-self-consciousness will manifest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not always deny what is not true for sometimes God appears there too Obey God in whatever way you can So you affirm God’s reality as is due</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Divinity can appear in human form, too so don’t deny your essence as the foolish do</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One should concentrate on this with belief in oneness (tawhid) and firm determination (‵azimat) and force of will (jam‵iyat) and pure sincerity (ikhlas) in a constant and continuous way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The seeker may contemplate the self as being the origin of divine disclosures rather than being the consequence of divine disclosures (tajalliyat). The seeker should keep this view constantly in sight. In this way, one should see all things as both absolute being (wujudi mutlaq) and limited being (wujudi muqayyad), with reality being that both types are indeed one. For naming something as absolute or naming something as limited are relative to the perspective and judgment of the observer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another method is to close the eyes and fix the gaze on the heart, then stay aware that God is present and watching and that God is with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The harder one practices the further one gets. The Sufi master Abu Hafs al-Haddad states, “Sufism is merely cooking what one imagines until it is done.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one must continually try, because to stop trying is the cause of losing spiritual concentration</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not let the name distract from the presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sound serves as a connection between the seeker and the One sought,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody attains the goal by their own searching Yet without searching nobody ever attains the goal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one who stays in a state of divine attraction and senselessness (majzub) is limited by this and does not progress beyond this stage, for without coming to one’s senses one cannot be worthy of giving spiritual training (tarbiyat).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ways of doing meditation, reflection and contemplation are all based on love</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The greater is one’s love the greater is the effect of all these practices. But if love is lax then their effect is lesser. These different types of spiritual practices might aid one to restore the strength and intensity of love that sometimes lags and weakens. One should never do these practices of meditation, reflection and contemplation merely to get some reward. A true lover’s aspiration is surely loftier than that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more subtle in nature the thing chosen as a medium, and the more profound its meaning for the intellect, the more intense is its effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your guide is one who shows you the way to your tranquility not one who leads you to your difficulty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My friend, in the opinion of this humble seeker, the heart can be said to exist in three places. The first place is within the chest towards the left side, and it is the physical organ of the heart, of flesh shaped like a pine-cone shaped</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second place wherein the heart is said to reside is the source of the mind (umm al-dimagh). It is called the spherical heart (dil-i mudawwar) and is sometimes called the heart that is pure of all qualities (be-rang). It has the special quality that when the seeker concentrates upon this spherical heart, no stray thought or temptation affects him, because no negative thought (khatra) can reach that place. The third place is in the very center of the seat of the body (nishast-gah), and this is called the lotus heart (dil-i nilofari).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when one meditates as mentioned above, one concentrates at the place of the physical heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another method of removing tempting thoughts is to consider them as not separate from yourself and not something other than you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This sound is called “infinite” (be-hadd) and “absolute” (mutlaq). There is no practice better than that of hearing this sound. This is because every other practice depends upon the will of the practitioner; if he for a moment stops it, the practice ceases. But not so this practice! It does not depend upon the will of the practitioner. It is present and available without ceasing and without interruption at all times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>direct your attention to your ears. Concentrate as hard and as long as you can until a very subtle sound manifests. Hearing this sound, it will gradually grow more powerful and overwhelming, so much so that will seem to come from all sides of you and there will be no place or no time when this sound will not manifest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations and blessings, my friend, if you become capable of this practice called “The Prime Recitation” (sultan al-azkar). For then the subtle world becomes apparent to you, and also an absolute being that is constant and eternal. If you perform this subtle practice, it will cause you to become more subtle in your very being, and plunge you into the ocean of subtlety and absolute being, free of conditions and qualities (itlaq be-rang).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know what is the meaning of being without grief? It means finding without searching and seeing without looking, because seeing through the eyes is imperfect and weak.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>any distracting thought comes to you, just consider it also to be one with the divine essence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then just as the divine essence is perfect, its perfection will come to dominate that distracting thought and it will no long be a distraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Purity and impurity, transcendence and immanence, all are manifest and take their existence from this divine essence. If you imagine that a single mote of dust is separate from the divine essence then you have lost the blessing of witnessing divine unity (tawhid) and mystical comprehension (‵irfan).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The absolute is always in the limited, and the limited is always with the absolute. It is truth that the limited form is not a veil obscuring absolute being. Existing beings do not exist independently from the absolute being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing in this universe that is other than you Whatever comes before you is just you confronting you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the last and greatest method of meditation, my friend, in this noble Sufi way. That is to sit grasping one’s own true nature, such that, in spite of all your limitations, consider yourself as the very absolute being and only existence. In this state, whatever comes to your sight as other than yourself you should recognize as identical to your self. In this way one extirpates the very root of duality and discards the veils of alienation and separation. One sees everything as partaking of one essence, and realizes the bliss of self merging with self,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A drop is just a drop as long as it believes it is separate from the sea</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As long as a veil remains between you and your love You long for the beauty and perfection of his face Yet your frame of vision is the veil you long to remove Abandon the frame, so no dust of dualism leaves a trace</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In separation from you I suffered anxiety From union with you I lost my life and piety What bliss it is that enraptures my being Now my body and soul enjoy tranquility</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you long to discover the proof of this, know that you can witness the sun of truth in every speck of dust that is visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pray in the late stretches of the night an additional voluntary prayer, that your Lord might send you to a praised station. Say, ‘Oh my Lord, make my entering by the entryway of sincerity and make my leaving by the exit of sincerity and let me receive from you an aiding authority!’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the head is Aries, Taurus is the shoulders, Gemini the hands, Cancer the arm, Leo the breast, Virgo the belly, Libra the navel, Scorpio the genitals, Sagittarius the thigh, Capricorn the leg, Aquarius the shank, and Pisces the sole of the foot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the Sun is the heart, Jupiter the liver, the moon the lungs (shush), Mercury the kidney (gurda), Saturn the spleen (supurz), Mars the brain, and Venus the gall bladder (zahra).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Know that the ear drinks water from the bladder, and because of that its water is bitter (talkh). The eye drinks water from the liver, and because of that, its water is salty (shor). The nose drinks water from the lungs, and therefore its water is (sour?). The tongue drinks water from the heart, and its water is sweet (shirin). Reason (‵aql) is in the head (dimagh), modesty in the eye (chashm), understanding is in the ear (gosh), knowledge in the breast (sina), and thought is in the heart (dil or qalb).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Knowledge is a single point.”</p>
