<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344270868l/2232663.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Lama Tsultrim Allione teaches you an ancient tibetan buddhism practice revisited for western people. It is a pragmatic exercise that can be done easily at home. A bit strange for everyone that meet this spiritual practice for the first time but definitely something to try or deepen.</p>
<p>It is a sort of self-guided meditation that light up <em>reasons</em> behind inner conflicts in order to solve them.</p>
<p>The book is really well written. Easy to understand and easy to read. There are summaries sections, case studies and a chapter dedicated to the original ancient practice.</p>
<p><strong>Even skeptics can learn something behind Tsultrim Allione’s words.</strong></p>
<p>The ancient practice name is Chöd, defined briefly and really well by Reprogramming Mind youtube channel as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chöd (Tibetan: གཅོད, Wylie: gcod lit. ‘to sever’), is a spiritual practice found primarily in the Nyingma and Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism (where it is classed as Anuttarayoga Tantra). Also known as “Cutting Through the Ego”, the practices are based on the Prajñāpāramitā or “Perfection of Wisdom” sutras, which expound the “emptiness” concept of Buddhist philosophy. According to Mahayana Buddhists, emptiness is the ultimate wisdom of understanding that all things lack inherent existence. Chöd combines prajñāpāramitā philosophy with specific meditation methods and tantric ritual. The chöd practitioner seeks to tap the power of fear through activities such as rituals set in graveyards, and visualisation of offering their bodies in a tantric feast in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the ultimate test. Interview is with, author and international teacher, founder and spiritual director of Tara Mandala. In 2009, Lama Tsultrim was selected by an esteemed committee of Buddhis.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>The Outer Limits of Reason</strong> is as far as I remember one of the best research essay that I have read so far. I definitely recommend the book to all inquiring minds around and to anyone who is too much confident about him/her-self knowledge.</p>
<p>Noson S. Yanofsky confirmed his knowledge page by page and with astonishing clarity explain hard topic such as Chaos, Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics. As a graduate student of Computer Science and Engineering I have found really well written explanations about theoretical computer science. Not for nothing Yanofsky is Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Brooklyn College and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.</p>

<p><em>Science is a human activity. It is created by finite, flawed human beings attempting to search for the ultimate truth.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>The mathematics becomes abstract and about nothing in particular. Because these concepts are about nothing, they are about everything.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Rather than asking why the laws of physics follow mathematics, ask why there are any laws at all.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>When we talk about the limits of scientific reasoning, we must keep in mind how we are observing the universe…the way we look at the universe is the way it will present itself to us.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Do not mistake the metaphor for reality.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SPOILER</strong>: Yanofsky conclusion thought</p>
<p><em>We human beings already live beyond reason. Real life has importance only when it includes ethics, values, and beauty. Reason is a powerful but nevertheless limited tool.</em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-zen-teaching-of-bodhidharma-the-zen-teaching-of-bodhidharma">The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma</h1>
<p><img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386924996l/238863.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Not an easy text as introduction to Zen teachings but definitely recommended. Like other old text, additional readings clarify concepts, inspire more and improve your understanding. You always find something to learn from them.</p>
<p>The teachings are essential and there are not useless words. Insights bring the reader to deeply understand sacred text and Sutra, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Often you must read carefully and you must pay attention and put lots of effort in order to get the idea.</p>
<p>Bodhidharma explains in the last few chapters the real meaning behind sages teachings. In order to reach enlightenment you do not focus on external practices. Sages use metaphors to facilitate beginners mind to understand the Way. Bodhidharma says that you must focus on your perceptions and your inner grow.</p>
<p>As others before me said, disciple must not be a repeater. He must renew the teachings and find new formulations that are right at the moment and in such new conditions. He must accomplish much more. Bodhidharma succeed on it and the reader must do the same.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="kombucha-healthy-beverage-and-natural-remedy-from-the-far-east">Kombucha: Healthy Beverage And Natural Remedy from the Far East</h1>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RrRHVrvnL.jpg" alt="image" width="250" /></p>
<p>The point of reference for Kombucha fans and lover.</p>
<p>The author was able to gather and share with readers tons of information such as: applications history details, hints for production, alternative recipes and He did it easily and in a comprehensible way.</p>
<p>References are from all the different cultures that have in common this special beverage in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Useful read to both beginners and experts. It is also helpful for inquiring minds that does not want to produce the tea by themselves.</p>
<p>I really appreciated quotes and the author’s philosophical thoughts that go along with the book.</p>]]></description>
