I am the developer and maintainer of `Starly <https://starly-info.github.io>`_,
an online free service that deliver knowledge by email. At the moment the first
newsletter is about the text editor `Vim <www.vim.org>`_ and it is called `Vimly
<https://starly-info.github.io/newsletter/en/2017-08-18-vim.html>`_.  Vimly help
you learn and better understand how Vim works, his awesome functionalities and
much more. Vimly delivers **knowledge pills** (chunks of the official `:help`
file) and **practice** sections where you can find exercises, questions and
answers.

I am pescetarian since 2014. I have started a journey of overall awareness that
continues to grow day by day.

I admire all people that pursue *something*. I love hearing their experiences
and thoughts about what they love to do. Often, I carry with me their likes and
soon or later I deepen these *things* by my own.

I enjoy reading, discussing, sharing knowledge and stay close to nature.
