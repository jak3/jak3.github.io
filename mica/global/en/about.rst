I am the developer and maintainer of `Vimly <http://vimly.info>`_, an online
free service that deliver knowledge by email. Vimly help you learn and better
understand how Vim works, his awesome functionalities and much more. Vimly
delivers **knowledge pills** (chunks of the official `:help` file) and

I was being pescetarian from 2014 to 2018. Now I am vegetarian. Since I have
changed my nutrition I have started a journey of overall awareness that
continues to grow day by day.

I admire all people that pursue *something*. I love hearing their experiences
and thoughts about what they love to do, I hear their heart speak. Often, I
carry with me their likes and soon or later I deepen these *things* by my own.

I enjoy reading, discussing, sharing knowledge and stay close to nature.
