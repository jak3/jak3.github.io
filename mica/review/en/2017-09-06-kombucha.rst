The point of reference for Kombucha fans and lover.

The author was able to gather and share with readers tons of information such as: applications history details, hints for production, alternative recipes and He did it easily and in a comprehensible way.

References are from all the different cultures that have in common this special beverage in their daily lives.

Useful read to both beginners and experts. It is also helpful for inquiring minds that does not want to produce the tea by themselves.

I really appreciated quotes and the author's philosophical thoughts that go along with the book.
