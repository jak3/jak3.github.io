*****************
The Bhagavad Gita
*****************

The best Bhagavad Gita version I have ever read. Pure and clean. Winthrop
Sargeant has done a wonderful work, due to his humbleness, he has received
critiques. I am sure that after reading the text entirely, all the critiques
vanish. An interlinear edition is indispensable in order to catch fully the
information that the source aimed to transmit. Thanks Winthrop Sargent and
Christopher Key Chapple.
