Every *Kriyaban* independent from his/her lineage find insights reading this
book. Lots of paragraph (transliterated) have been taken directly from Shama
Churn diaries and memories are reported as it is. I appreciate also the
glossary, really well detailed. A true teaching the words of this book and I
must admit that sometimes truth reveal itself against your previous precepts.
You must be always open minded to changes, evaluate them deeply with your inner
Self and choose. Personally, I have do some changes to my *sadhana*. I write to
you some of the phrases that catch my attention into categories:

General topics
--------------

- *Kriyayoga* is absolutely scientific.

- Everyone should receive education.

- Obeisance by touching His feet was not preferred by Him.

- Still your mind by doing *PranaKarma*.

- Parents are great gurus, they are worthy of reverence.

- Merely try to know yourself, that is *sadhana*. Knowing oneself in this manner
  is the ultimate and supreme fulfillment of human life.

- Everything in the universe is existent in this body.

- What occurs mentally occurs physically also, when the mental illusion is
  removed, the physical illusion will gradually be removed.

- Ten types of *Anahata* sound can be heard: chirr, continuous chirr, small bell,
  conch, lute, rhythm, snake-chamber-s flute, wooden tom-tom, concerted drum
  music, prolonged bell.

- Perception is in accordance with mental disposition.

- The kinetic mind has to be reposed in the triangle within *Kutastha*. The mind
  has to be mounted on the *Ajna* *Cakra*, then rotated from right to left. An
  extremely minute mustard seed-like dot could be envisioned within that
  triangle.

- Regarding the offering of the mind, the tenth chapter of *Srimadbhagavata* has a
  remarkable narrative. While visiting *Bhagavan* Krishna, the *gopinis* desired to
  take some offerings along with them. But what offering should they take? He
  possesses everything. The *gopinis* contemplated that they have to offer Him
  such an object which He did not possess. Eventually, they discovered that
  *Bhagavan* has everything excepting the mind, which they possessed in abundance.
  Therefore they offered their minds completely to *Bhagavan*.

- White does not pertain to the category of colour. It infers neutrality.

- Sun and Moon merged into one.

- All the forms which can be visualized while practicing *Kriya*, what those forms
  are, from where they emanate and in what manner they can be visualized, all
  these thoughts give rise to malice and for visualizing this attachment
  evolves.  A perceptible object is destructible. *Kriya*'s transcendental state
  which is beyond the Brahma Who exists within all shapes in the form of *anu*, is
  the knowledge of essence.

- If the present does not exist, past and future also do not exist. Therefore
  the past and future subsist on the present. Abandoning the present does not
  bring forth direct perception. The direct perception is within the fold of
  time; without time there cannot be direct perception. When direct perception
  occurs, then present exists, thus due to dearth of the present or of time,
  direct perception becomes a non-entity.

- Recollection is not possible without symptoms, because it is
  symptom-dependant.

- The essence of *Kutastha* is soul, soul's essence in turn is the mind and mind's
  essence is the senses.

- Any visualization infers attachment. Even in the visualization of *Bhagavan*
  Krishna attachment is inherent but in the non-visualization detachment
  inheres.

- Applying deceitful stratagem all material benefits can be acquired, but not
  soul-attainment.

- None is a sinner or a saint.


Who must practice *yogasadhana*
-------------------------------

- Material world cannot be renounced. *Sadhana* is not for renouncers only.

- *Sadhana* has to be practiced and at the same time you have to earn your
  livelihood. It is improper to depend upon someone for your subsistence. You
  should maintain your family yourself.

- There is no impediment to practice the *yoga*sadhana** for men belonging to
  any religion or for those adhering to any doctrine. The same soul prevails in
  all living beings. Therefore there is no impediment for practicing
  Atma*sadhana*.

- Since everything originates from Brahma everyone can be termed as Brahmin
  Soul-introspection is the principal aim of life, and every sadhaka of the
  world, without exception can do it.

- Shama Churn illustrate how man though by remaining in the vortex of material
  actions can direct his life towards the exalted ideals of the spiritual world
  and gradually reach the pinnacle of spiritualism. He merely did not stop at
  expressing these ideals verbally to everyone but completely executing this in
  His Own life, He set an example.

- He would remark that the two requisites to practise this immortal
  *yoga*sadhana** are a human body and a true desire.

- None is sinful or sinless. Everyone is equal. Since everyone is the son of
  God, everyone has the right to practice *sadhana*.


*Sadhana* hints
---------------


- Five to six hours of sleep regularly is a must.

- Pure food, easily digestible.

- No bathe at dawn

- Not undertake a rigorous fast

- Not be awake till very late at night

- Do not practice *Kriya* when there is thunders

- *Kriya* in the morning annihilates the sins of the night and *Kriya* in the
  evening annihilates the sins of the day

- Women should not practice kriya during menstruation

- Impart *Kriya* to married couples together

- It is better to practice *Atmasadhana* a couple of hours before dawn, for during
  this period nature being calm.

- There is no rule pertaining to direction, place and time for practice *kriya*.

- *Sambhavi mudra*, *Kechari Mudra*, *Omkara kriya* and *Kevala Kumbhaka* are the main
  things to do. *Kumbhaka* will result autonomously, do not strive for it. If the
  two actions of *recaka* and *puraka* are internally practiced, an automatic
  *kumbhaka* will result.

- Idol-worship was never practiced by Shama Churn. He would ask people to abide
  by their respective faiths, would impart afflatus to them and advise them to
  practice *yoga*sadhana**.

- There is no need to take a photograph (of a guru). Otherwise in the future you
  could abandon *sadhana* and start worshiping the photograph and you shouldn't.

- Yogiraj Himself would never do *japa* of any names or mantras and would not
  impart these to His devotees. He was never noticed to have observed fasting or
  performed gross worship. He would fast once in a year on *Sivaratri* day.

- Where a devoted disciple's ritual practice ends, a yogi's spiritual practice
  begins.

- Undertaking external pilgrimages does not cause soul-attainment. Until you are
  aware about the soul-pilgrimage, you cannot attain salvation.

- Not practicing *sadhana* of any god separately, but by firmly existing in the
  fundamental soul-essence, all the deities have been effected to be in His
  *sadhana*.

About God
---------

- God is not an Object or Someone Who has descended from the sky, God is a state
  of being.

- There is only One Who can give and He gives through the medium of someone.

- Name and form belong to the body or any object, by what name will you invoke
  God? He is beyond name and form. Who else is nearer to you than Him? He dwells
  within you, therefore how can you loudly invoke Him? Does any person call
  himself by his own name? It is not necessary.

- Someone exists within you, repeatedly invoke Him.

- A devotee prayed Shama Churn asking "What is God?", Yogiraj enlightened thus
  "Do you know Who God is? The power by which you asked 'What is God'. He only
  is God.
