I can not review a book like this. Everyone interested in Hermetic Teachings and
or in a path to self-knowledge, *should really* read it. It is written clearly and is really short, there is not a useless word.

Table of Contents:

+ The Hermetic Philosophy
+ The Seven Hermetic Principles
  - The Principle of Mentalism
  - The Principle of Correspondence
  - The Principle of Vibration
  - The Principle of Polarity
  - The Principle of Rhythm
  - The Principle of Cause and Effect
  - The Principle of Gender
+ Mental Transmutation
+ The All
+ The Mental Universe
+ The Divine Paradox
+ "The All" in All
+ Planes of Correspondence
+ Vibration
+ Polarity
+ Rhythm
