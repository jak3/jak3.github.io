I can not review a book like this. Everyone interested in Hermetic Teachings and
or in a path to self-knowledge, *should really* read it. It is written clearly and is really short, there is not a useless word.

    1. The Principle of Mentalism
    2. The Principle of Correspondence
    3. The Principle of Vibration
    4. The Principle of Polarity
    5. The Principle of Rhythm
    6. The Principle of Cause and Effect
    7. The Principle of Gender
