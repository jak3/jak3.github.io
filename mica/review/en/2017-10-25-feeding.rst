Lama Tsultrim Allione teaches you an ancient tibetan buddhism practice revisited
for western people. It is a pragmatic exercise that can be done easily at home.
A bit strange for everyone that meet this spiritual practice for the first time
but definitely something to try or dig deeper.

It is a sort of self-guided meditation that light up *reasons* behind
inner conflicts in order to solve them.

The book is really well written. Easy to understand and easy to read. There are
summaries sections, case studies and a chapter dedicated to the original ancient
practice.

**Even skeptics can learn something behind Tsultrim Allione's words.**

The ancient practice name is Chöd, defined briefly and really well by
Reprogramming Mind youtube channel as:


  Chöd (Tibetan: གཅོད, Wylie: gcod lit. 'to sever'), is a spiritual practice
  found primarily in the Nyingma and Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism (where it
  is classed as Anuttarayoga Tantra). Also known as "Cutting Through the Ego",
  the practices are based on the Prajñāpāramitā or "Perfection of Wisdom"
  sutras, which expound the "emptiness" concept of Buddhist philosophy.
  According to Mahayana Buddhists, emptiness is the ultimate wisdom of
  understanding that all things lack inherent existence. Chöd combines
  prajñāpāramitā philosophy with specific meditation methods and tantric ritual.
  The chöd practitioner seeks to tap the power of fear through activities such
  as rituals set in graveyards, and visualisation of offering their bodies in a
  tantric feast in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the ultimate
  test. Interview is with, author and international teacher, founder and
  spiritual director of Tara Mandala. In 2009, Lama Tsultrim was selected by an
  esteemed committee of Buddhis.
