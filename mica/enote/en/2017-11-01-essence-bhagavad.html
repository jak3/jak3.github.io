<blockquote>
<p>One final thought: When you give people a choice of product or service tiers, you do something subtle but powerful. You shift the internal question for the customer from, “Should I buy this?” to “Which one should I buy?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it should be added that in this realm of appearances maya does have its own reality. Everything is a dream, but even dreams, as dreams, are real.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-realization and the knowledge of God, are synonymous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the truths propounded in the Gita are applicable at all levels of life: material, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Paramhansa Yogananda makes the point that every great scripture is multi-leveled, addressing the vast variety of human needs from a standpoint of divine wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there are several paths to God, according, not to people’s beliefs, but to each person’s own temperament. He delineates the right attitudes for the devotee, the various delusions that can prevent him from finding God, and the way to overcome them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A true scripture, Paramhansa Yogananda stated, addresses human needs in their entirety.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>three nadis, or subtle channels of life force, called</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the spiritual eye, one may ask, merely symbolic? No, it is actually beheld, and is, in fact, a reflection of the light in the medulla, through which the energy moves down the spine in three nadis, or subtle channels of life force, called the sushumna, the vajra, and the chitra.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Circumstances,” Paramhansa Yogananda commented, “are always neutral. They appear positive or negative according to the corresponding reactions of the heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every act, every thought, has its specific consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This means we should not depend on our good habits alone to see us through psychological and spiritual tests. Habit born of past actions may give us good karma, but karma itself must be transcended in dedication to the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when you succeed in converting enough mental citizens to the side of goodness, they will outnumber the unruly ones and will gradually win them over, resulting in your rapid spiritual progress.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We must transform our faults into virtues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every human trait begins as a simple thought. There is nothing man can achieve or even conceive that, as an idea, is inaccessible to any other human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The part played by the guru is not to make his disciples over in his own image, but, by sharing his magnetism with them, to uplift their consciousness</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How is one to know what course in life is right or wrong? The first rule is, “Do what works.” That is why the question, “What was the outcome?” is more important than, “What are they doing?” Only from the outcome of a course of action can it be known with any certainty whether the act was justified or not. The maxim, “The end justifies the means,” is true only as long as the end is visualized in theory, in advance. Once it has been actually reached, however, it will show whether the means to it were right or not. Wrong means to an imaginary good end will produce, at last, disharmony and failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Judge your thoughts and actions by their effects—on yourself, first; then on others. Are they peace-inducing? Are they as universally beneficial as possible? Do they help to expand your understanding and sympathies? Have they brought greater harmony to your environment?—or have they produced disharmony? Do they inspire you and others? or have they brought less hope generally—even despair?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One should not wish harm to anything, but one may be obliged to kill harmful creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Arjuna, nothing is ever lost. What you relinquish on the material plane you will rediscover a thousand times more wonderfully in God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sensations such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain are generated through the senses in (their) contact with the world. They are ideas only: transitory, each with its beginning and end. O Descendent of Bharata, bear with them patiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one who is calm and even-minded, never ruffled during pain and pleasure: he alone gains consciousness of his eternal existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why lament that which cannot be avoided?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>stoicism</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One needs to know why it is necessary to seek truth, how best to go about it, and what one may expect (stated with as much intellectual clarity as possible, though emphasizing that direct experience alone conveys true understanding).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Renunciation of the world in thought as well as in deed is essential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mind itself is the battlefield. There is no other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true Self can be sustained only by spiritual states of consciousness, such as divine love, calmness, and bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether they are greeted with pleasure or distaste depends entirely on one’s mental conditioning. The human mind, unlike the minds of lower animals, can train itself to like anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“as if smiling.” This phrase, Yogananda said, is important, because it indicates that God is no stern judge of human behavior, but is “on our side.” He wants us to advance spiritually, and forever forgives us if we err.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be “even-minded and cheerful” under all circumstances is the first duty of the yogi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>even-mindedly toward his goal by performing ever calmly his karmically assigned duties. To be “even-minded and cheerful” under all circumstances is the first duty of the yogi. This</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be “even-minded and cheerful” under all circumstances is the first duty of the yogi. This obviously does not mean being cheerful about other people’s suffering! One must respect, and even empathize with, their pains—as Krishna did. As regards one’s own pains, however, the aspiring yogi must firmly banish all thought of ego-identification with both pleasure and pain. Pain may in fact be “happening,” but he must not think of it as his own. The more he can resist the oppositional states of Nature—maya’s dualities (dwaita)—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>good practice for the devotee is deliberately to submit himself to extreme opposites: heat and cold, pleasure and pain, etc. He should be careful not to test his powers too far beyond their proven ability so far. To do so would be fanaticism. Indeed, it might prove counter-productive: One could stand too long under a cold shower, and find himself hardly feeling warm again for months! One could even endanger his health. Along with the counsel to be even-minded and cheerful is an equally important one: Use common sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For even-mindedness, an important practice is to give up likes and dislikes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing belongs to you—not even your own ego! Firmly to hold this attitude is the way to inner freedom</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the refusal to act is a kind of activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the ego? Imagine the moon reflected in many vessels of water. Each vessel contains the same reflection, yet the reflection seems, in each of them, to be individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision not to act is like restraining a horse by the reins: It takes an effort of will, and therefore implies an act of some kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>spiritual progress consists not in actually achieving anything, but in simply removing the distortions that obscure the nature of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter Eleven</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this yoga there is only that one direction (with no polar opposite).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the sincere spiritual aspirant, little could seem more like hell than to be stuck for all eternity in an ego, even if the body in which one lives is forever healthy, supple, youthful, and full of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Heaven is usually offered as bait: a place where people spend eternity in a beautiful, idyllic environment of great natural beauty, surrounded by “angels.” To the sincere spiritual aspirant, little could seem more like hell than to be stuck for all eternity in an ego, even if the body in which one lives is forever healthy, supple, youthful, and full of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“center everywhere, circumference nowhere,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>only Hinduism (and I say this as one who was, himself, raised in orthodox Christianity) formally teaches moksha, or liberation from the very ego, in union with the Omnipresent, Divine Consciousness. Jesus Christ taught it. Few however, if any, of his self-declared followers believe that when he spoke of heaven he was referring to that same state of moksha: complete liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>most religious teachers offer a compromise of lower spiritual truths, they betray their own religion. Paramhansa Yogananda used to say, “Jesus Christ was crucified once, but his teachings have been crucified every day, throughout Christendom, since that time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If only Hinduism declares this highest spiritual truth, surely it is because only Hinduism has not been confined in the “straitjacket” of a religious organization! It has grown naturally, rather, and has not been suffocated in the musty air of official decrees regarding what is, and what is not, the highest truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>its attachment to the results of action. Those results, because of that attachment, must return to their source.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pray in this way: ‘I will reason, I will will, I will act, but guide Thou my reason, will, and activity to the right path in everything.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to this achievement is to remain ever calm in the Self, free from any thought of either acceptance or possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pride goes before a fall.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scripture itself is no substitute for self-effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>well when the land all around is in flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the Vedas are of no more use than a well when the land all around is in flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To the knower of Brahman (the Supreme Spirit) the Vedas are of no more use than a well when the land all around is in flood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>wanting some sort of ego-payment for favors rendered. The Lord is no merchant</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who seek lesser favors from God are asking for a teaspoon of soil when they might have the whole kingdom. The problem in people’s minds is, of course, that they think to possess.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To attain God-consciousness, it is necessary to release all attachment to thoughts of “I” and “mine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people—many hermits, for example—</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect evenness of mind and feeling is itself the definition of yoga.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Affirmations of calmness in the midst of stress often have the contrary effect of creating more tension! In any case, calmness can be affirmed effectively only with inner calmness. Such calmness can hardly be established without also stilling the thoughts in meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One can run nervously,” the Master replied, “or one can run calmly, but not to run when one needs to is to be lazy!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pranayama is a condition, not a technique.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>withdrawal of the energy is the true meaning of pranayama: “yama (control) of the prana (energy).” Pranayama is a condition, not a technique. The practice of pranayama is to achieve energy control.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Breathlessness is deathlessness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is helpful, when trying to develop emotional detachment, to concentrate one’s energy in the spine,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two requirements, above all, for the attainment of wisdom. One, to withdraw the mind not only from sense objects, but from the senses themselves; and, two, to remain merged in the consciousness of God as the most desirable of all goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>suffering diminishes when there is a decrease of self-interest. The discernment of this truth leads to the first faint stirrings of recollection that a reality exists that is more than the ego and the body. The fog of delusion begins to lift from the mind, and one no longer strikes out at the world in anger for not giving him what he wants. From acceptance of what is comes a gradual decrease of worldly attachment. From lessened attachment comes lessening interest in the objects of the senses, and an increase of longing for true wisdom—a longing which awakens devotion in the heart, love of truth, and intense aspiration to know true and everlasting bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mistakes on the path are always possible. The devotee should acknowledge them sincerely and openly (at least to himself), and then simply forsake them. He should avoid the further mistake of becoming upset with himself. He should keep his mind focused steadfastly on the polestar of his true goal: union with God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the ego is a delusion, anything that tempts it to affirm its own separate reality is a delusion also. And so too, indeed, is any distress one may feel with oneself for having succumbed to delusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you feel pleasure, let it remind you of soul-bliss. Whenever you see beauty, take into yourself the joy you feel in it. Let every worldly happiness remind you of the much greater happiness of the Self. Some yogis recommend complete indifference to the world. What a dry outlook! Far better is it, my Guru taught, to enjoy with God the beauties and the pure delights of this world, by focusing on the inner joy you feel during experiences that uplift the heart’s feelings</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Spiritual progress is achieved not by the tense effort demanded for material success, but rather by a process of upward relaxation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the key to right meditation is relaxation—physically, emotionally, and mentally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>High truths cannot be learned: they can only be remembered in the Self.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>doing harm to others never succeeded in bringing him happiness;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All who would unite their souls with God must follow that same path: yama and niyama (right action); asana (firmness of posture, and keeping the spine straight to enable the energy to flow freely through it); pranayama (control over the energy of the body); pratyahara (interiorization of the mind); dharana (one-pointed concentration); dhyana (absorption in deep meditation); and samadhi (oneness).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Actionlessness cannot be attained by mere inaction. One who forsakes work (in the name of divine aloofness from activity) cannot reach perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My Guru explained that a liberated master, whatever his role on earth, never loses his inner awareness of freedom</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can they cease from breathing by merely not breathing? Can they refrain from thinking by merely not thinking? Can they achieve silence by merely not speaking? One wonders how any aspirant to wisdom can conceive such absurdities! All creation exists in a vibratory state. The very atoms are constantly in movement. Prakriti (Nature) forces man to be active. Anyone who tries to be inactive becomes merely lazy. Anyone who pretends to be disinvolved in the world around him is being merely hypocritical. In order to achieve the actionless state it is utterly necessary to act consciously—not merely driven by Nature, but deliberately and intelligently, like a surfer going with the waves of circumstance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>any show of religiosity is acceptable only according to the depth of inner sincerity involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wish to impress indicates a desire for results, rather than true sincerity of feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The greater the will, the greater the flow of energy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No activity engaged in merely to impress others (or even God) will, in the end, bear divine fruit. Spiritual progress is achieved above all by desiring it intensely, and not by inflicting violent discipline on the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform those actions which your duty dictates, for action is better than inaction. Without action, in-deed, even the act of maintaining life in the body would not be possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is often best to undertake first those battles which one can be more confident of winning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“One moment,” the saying goes, “in the company of a saint can be your raft over the ocean of delusion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Very few human beings are ready for the highest spiritual blessing: the help of a true guru.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The work before him of achieving infinity is colossal! If he has any wisdom at all, he must surely see that he needs all the help he can get!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Life must be continuously progressive. If it tries to remain stationary, it is already living death. There are devas, or angels, to whom we can appeal, or with whose energies we can work in cooperation. As with other human beings, we gain much more by giving to them than by trying to snatch our gain from them. Even in the ashrams of great gurus, those disciples receive the most spiritually who, by their appreciation, give energy and don’t try to draw God’s blessings self-centeredly to themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The age we now live in is an upward-moving age (not Kali Yuga, as people generally believe</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All things exist in a state of vibration. That is how the Supreme, ever-unmoving Spirit brought about the appearance of a reality separate from itself. As the blades of a fan, rotating rapidly, give the appearance of a solid circular disk, so Cosmic Vibration, in its infinite number of intensely rapid vibrations, gives the appearance of substance, variety, even of solidity. Thus we have, for example, the rocks, which to our senses appear very solid but which are now known to be only vibrations of energy, and which, even as material substance, are composed largely of space.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without images, people’s devotion becomes dry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>feel that the energy which enables him to move and breathe is not his own, personally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To gorge one’s food gluttonously is to feed not only the body but the ego.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Vibration is action, which is to say, karma.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AUM is properly written with three letters. The first letter signifies Brahma; the second one, Vishnu; and the third (properly pronounced as a slightly drawn-out hum), Shiva.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>AUM samadhi. His next perception is of Kutastha Chaitanya, or Tat, the Christ consciousness behind the vibrations of his body—and the center of every vibration of the body, reflecting the motionless Spirit beyond creation. Gradually his consciousness expands with the Christ consciousness, or Tat, until he perceives it as infinite. It is after reaching that stage, my Guru explained to me, that one may be called a master.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suffering comes primarily from the thought,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more things change, the more they remain unchanged.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What needs changing is no social system, but human consciousness. The best way to change society, surely, would be to create little societies that can inspire others to make the recommended changes, individually, in themselves, rather than forcing everyone to march in lock-step togetherness toward some general “good” that often ends in disaster. If an example works, others may be inspired by it, and may want to change. Without the desire to change, no one will ever do better at anything. The first responsibility the universe places on every person’s shoulders is this: “Change yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>yet still I work on for the upliftment of others. There, where all uplifting work is done, am I.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never should the wise condemn the ignorant for the ego-motivation they manifest. Instead, being themselves enlightened, they should seek only to inspire others in the direction of preferring to perform right, dutiful action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>as foolish people, out of attachment to ego, act in hope of rewards, so should the wise also (even if wisdom has lifted them out of any personal need to be active), act with dispassion and non-attachment, glad to be of service to others as their guides</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To drive a dark mood out of the mind, for example, try this simple method: Focus your energy and attention strongly at the point between the eyebrows. The magnetism you generate there will lift you out of the fogs of gloom to a higher, more spiritual atmosphere where peace, joy, and complete acceptance reign.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He should not, however, allow anything to disturb his inner peace. Even if he sees wrong in the world, and accepts it as a manifestation of maya, he can remain inwardly undisturbed by it, and can work impersonally to improve matters in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Work with what is, not with what you think should be.” All human suffering is due to the simple thought that things ought to be other than they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t let others tell you what you, in their eyes, ought to be. On the other hand, never dismiss their advice arrogantly. Try at the same time, rather, to be always true to your own nature. You will never change yourself by suppression. Real change comes only by transcendence. If there is some quality in yourself that you don’t like, try to lift your awareness to a higher level.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never let yourself become infatuated (infatuation is extreme attraction) with anything or anyone. Never let yourself hate anything or anyone. Develop an attitude, rather, of accepting the cosmic dream as it is, even when it becomes a nightmare!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“People are so skillful in their ignorance!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Time must simply pass, as nature takes its course, and brings that person gradually to the point where, after repeated disappointments and the slight glimmering of hope for greater understanding, the inner person finally emerges in the full dignity of a refined human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Desire is the sinful destroyer of wisdom and of Self-realization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The senses are declared to be superior to the body (since they convey perception); the mind is superior to the senses (both inner and outer, since it is the perceiver); the discriminating intellect is superior to the mind (since it understands what it perceives); and the Self is superior to the discriminating intellect (since it is both perception and understanding).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is difficult for man to perceive that every state of consciousness already contains its opposite: that, in happiness, suffering is already present; and that (fortunately) suffering already contains at its center the seeds of joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God is Infinite Consciousness. Only Kali Yuga consciousness could have visualized Him as uniquely possessing a human form—as people believed the Earth was the center of everything, and still believed as late as the end of the nineteenth century that our sun was the center. Once every soul encased in an ego prison realizes itself as the Infinite, and no longer one little “sliver of glass” individually reflecting the cosmic light, it becomes the Infinite—God Himself. There is no difference, in essence, between Krishna, Jesus Christ, Buddha, or any other great master. There is no difference—again, in essence—between them and the rest of us, once we realize ourselves as the one God who, for a time, thought himself encased in these human egos. Everything is God. In God, all comparisons and relativities cease. The soul of Everyman was never born; nor did it ever die. In Vedantic truth there was always only one reality, one Spirit: the Supreme Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A few only, out of compassion for mankind, preserve that little “desireless desire” which brings them back to earth as avatars for the salvation of many. No avatar, however, in ultimate Reality, can be greater than any other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No avatar was ever created perfect. All of them were once like us, imperfect human beings who were finally washed clean in the realization of their own divinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>God destroys evil-doers. God never destroys anyone! The only thing He destroys—the only thing He can destroy, since He cannot destroy Himself—is evil itself: never the evil-doer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Satchidananda: ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the center of all movement, there is rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though acting, I am without attachment; nor do I desire any particular outcome from (any) activity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Digging a ditch—mere physical labor, in other words—can be either good, bad, or self-stultifying depending on one’s attitude while working.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The more whole-heartedly one can immerse himself in the feeling as well as the meaning of the ritual he performs, the more he will absorb divine inspiration into himself, until his very life becomes a ritual of self-offering, or yagya, to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Watch yourself eating, walking, breathing, conversing, thinking. Stand mentally aside from your own body and mind. Become the silent observer of your own self. Gradually you will feel inwardly detached, and will accept that you are another reality altogether: the divine soul merely dreaming everything that happens to its individual-seeming consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>incoming breath (prana) into the outgoing breath (apana),</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The slow, careful, conscious circulation of energy around the spine constitutes the ancient science known (since the time of Lahiri Mahasaya in the nineteenth century) as Kriya Yoga.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kriya Yoga, in order to be wholly effective, must be received not only intellectually (in written or spoken form), but vibrationally, in the form of initiation. A magnet is created either by electrical realignment of the molecules, or by close proximity to another magnet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Spiritual mistakes can be costlier, in terms of long-range suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to take up Kriya Yoga signifies entering seriously onto the path to God. It is not a game, and should certainly be treated as a lifetime commitment.</p>

In this case, too, each exhaling breath can be a little death (of the discarded quality, anyway), and each inhalation can be a little rebirth into some new quality one desires to adopt.</p>

<p>When others are agitated (and you might be, too), tell yourself, “Things will be normal again in a few hours, or days, or another week—or another month—or another year.” However long the period, it will end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>accepting whatever is as, simply, what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For much that passes for success in worldly eyes is not really even good karma, and may actually result in a person’s eventual spiritual downfall and long-range misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One is the fact that success comes as a result of focused concentration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“As long as you make the effort, God will never let you down.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Arjuna, know this for a certainty: My devotee is never lost.” One further thought remains, both to stiffen one’s resolution and to brighten one’s hope: Once the desire for God awakens in the heart, that desire must be fulfilled. It is already his guarantee of salvation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The very fact that desires can lead to anger should be a sufficient indication that the desires themselves are manifestations of bondage, not of freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fight dispassionately, without attachment to the results. This is the secret of true ahimsa, non-violence (harmlessness). Sometimes one must destroy in order to honor his higher duty. He need not, however, wish destruction on anything or anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the effect of prayer depends not on any prayer-formula, however valid in itself, but on the attitude of the person praying.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each one’s faith depends upon his nature. As a man is, so is his faith. As his faith is, so is the man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are, in other words, what we believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the vibrations of what one eats. For this reason also, it is important that food be prepared in an uplifted frame of mind, and not under the influence of such harmful emotions as anger, grief, deep worry, or depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the food one eats has an effect on mental clarity and upliftment, it plays an important role not only in one’s bodily health but also in one’s spiritual life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This threefold austerity (of body, speech, and mind) is sattwic in nature; it is practiced by persevering seekers (blessed with) deep devotion, who desire not the fruits of their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My Guru used to say that to give food or money to someone in need is good; to give him a job is better; and to help him to become qualified to get a good job is best of all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On a mental plane, to give good advice inappropriately, to someone who is not likely to benefit from it, would be a mistake also. Give counsel charily, when it is clearly wanted and requested, and never impose it on anybody: This is sattwic counseling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sat stands for eternal and absolute truth: the Supreme Spirit, above and beyond all vibration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>on continued effort until there is no sense of doing, doer, and done because one is merged in the Infinite</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Krishna means also that one should abandon as early as possible the absurd tendency of the doubting mind</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The wise understand renunciation to be the relinquishing of any action performed with (personal) desire. They also declare that it is not action itself which should be abandoned, but only that action which desires the fruits of action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tantra is an approach to God that teaches one to be strong in himself in the very teeth of temptation. It is a “back staircase” to God, and spiritually very dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The activity involved in yagya (sacrifice), philanthropic works, and the austerities (listed in 17:14–16) ought certainly to be engaged in, and should not be abandoned, for, when performed with wisdom, (they) purify the heart. (18:6) Even these (self-uplifting) activities, however, ought to be performed without attachment (either) to them or to their fruits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One who gives up a duty because he finds it difficult, or because he fears it will cause him pain, relinquishes that action with rajasic consciousness (motivated by desire and attachment).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(A true disciple of a true guru will never pit one of those against the other.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One who is wise in his renunciation is ever calm in himself, and is never doubtful. He has no aversion to unpleasant actions, nor is he attached to pleasant ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>who thinks of his ego as the sole doer of everything accomplished by him shows no understanding at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as death, but only transition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In divine consciousness, knowing, knower, and known are one and the same. The person is, in fact, the thing known: he is not only the knower. Thus, for example, learning, for him, is no longer difficult, since he already is that knowledge! He is also the act of knowing, which means that, in learning, he doesn’t really absorb anything new.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sattwic action is motivated by superconscious inspiration. It is performed without attachment, without likes or dislikes, and without desire for any fruits accruing from</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sattwic courage, on the other hand, is based on perfect knowledge, and on acceptance of the possible consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Krishna has said there may, occasionally, be a right motivation for fear: when the action one contemplates might put one in karmic error.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>body and senses controlled by pranayama.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When we lift up one hand to God, He reaches two down to help us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even saints manifest tamoguna (tamas), although, relatively speaking, to a very mild degree. They manifest it in the fact that they sleep, or take rest. Even tamasic or very evil people, moreover, show the sattwic quality to a mild degree when they do anything good for anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sense control (by the practice of pranayama),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mind control (concentration), sense control (by the practice of pranayama), self-restraint, purity, forgiveness, integrity, wisdom, meditation to attain Self-realization, and faith in a higher truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The duty of a Vaishya is to include the benefit of others in his own activities. Thus, he will become more sensitive to the needs of others, and will develop, in time, the nature of a Kshatriya.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A true Kshatriya stands up for what he believes, but his rectitude will be appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a duty conflicts with a higher duty, it ceases to be a duty.” In other words, if there are several things one can do well, he should concentrate on that activity which will most expand his sympathies and uplift his consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every human being must follow his own star. The higher one rises toward inner freedom, the more imperative becomes this advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one should not abandon the work dictated by his own nature, even though (the work) contain some imperfection, for all undertakings (even the best) are marred by blemishes, even as a flame is (obscured) by smoke.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That person comes closest to attaining perfection who keeps his intellect non-attached to everything outside the Self, who reigns in victory over the Self, and from whom (all) desires have fled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To know one’s Self is to know God! To know one’s Self is to know everything!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>abiding in a solitary place, eating lightly, controlling the body, speech, and mind; absorbing oneself in divine yoga meditation; dispassionate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>creating a “place of seclusion” in one’s own home. Set aside one room, or even a screened-off portion of your bedroom, where the only activity allowed is meditation. Superconscious vibrations will develop there, and will effectively “screen out” the surrounding, worldly atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now then, do as you feel.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cosmic drama needs suspense, excitement, at times terror, and at other times thrilling beauty. Man needs to feel that the ending to it all is highly uncertain, and may, for him, prove disastrous. Only thus will his interest throughout keep him “on the edge of his seat.” Every soul’s journey is unique. It is filled with uncertainties, with sorrow mingled with joy, with hope mingled with despair, with triumph mingled with crushing defeat, with dark doubt as to whether life has any meaning at all followed by the discovery of human love, of success, of history-making knowledge, of undreamed-of power, of joyful laughter followed by heart-wrenching tears. If man could know, through this long journey, that God’s love was always with him—deeply, eternally, unconditionally—he might well preen himself on that “good fortune,” grow cocky, and never learn the attitudes absolutely necessary for entering into, and becoming one with, that love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never share these truths with one who is without self-control or devotion, nor with one who won’t share with others in a spirit of service, nor give them to one who is indifferent to them, or who finds fault with Me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>never try to impose even good ideas on anyone, even if you are sure of those truths in yourself. People need to ask, first. They must seek understanding. To try to force even wisdom on them would be an offense against their eternal birthright of free will.</p>
