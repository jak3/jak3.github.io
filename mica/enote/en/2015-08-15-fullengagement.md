# The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal (Loehr, Jim;Schwartz, Tony)

> Human beings are complex energy systems, and full engagement is not simply
> one-dimensional. The energy that pulses through us is physical, emotional,
> mental, and spiritual.

> We, too, must learn to live our own lives as a series of sprints—fully
> engaging for periods of time, and then fully disengaging and seeking renewal
> before jumping back into the fray to face whatever challenges confront us.

> As Nietzsche put it, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.”

> The power of rituals is that they insure that we use as little conscious
> energy as possible where it is not absolutely necessary, leaving us free to
> strategically focus the energy available to us in creative, enriching ways.

> Too much energy expenditure without sufficient recovery eventually leads to
> burnout and breakdown. (Overuse it and lose it.) Too much recovery without
> sufficient stress leads to atrophy and weakness. (Use it or lose it.)

> Cultures that encourage people to seek intermittent renewal not only inspire
> greater commitment, but also more productivity.

> We are oscillatory beings in an oscillatory universe. Rhythmicity is our
> inheritance.

> Expanding capacity requires a willingness to endure short-term discomfort in
> the service of long-term reward.

> “We can experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas
> enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention . . .
> ,” writes psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of Flow. “The best
> moments [in our lives] usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched
> to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and
> worthwhile.”

> the key to expanding capacity is both to push beyond one’s ordinary limits and
> to regularly seek recovery, which is when growth actually occurs.

> The most important rhythms in our lives are the ones we typically take for
> granted—most notably breathing and eating.

simplest antidotes to anger and anxiety is to take deep abdominal breaths.

> occurs only when the vaccine is given in the proper dosage, stress inoculation
> occurs only when the stress intensity is at the optimal level—high enough to
> activate a person’s psychological and biological systems, but low enough so as
> not to overwhelm them. If the stress level is not high enough, inoculation
> will not occur; if the stress level is too high, stress sensitization will
> occur, and the individual will probably perform less effectively when he is
> stressed again.

> Researchers such as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi have found that prolonged
> television watching is actually correlated with increased anxiety and
> low-level depression. Conversely, the richer and deeper the source of
> emotional recovery, the more we refill our reserves and the more resilient we
> become. Effective emotional renewal puts us in a position to perform more
> effectively, especially under pressure.

> To be fully engaged emotionally requires celebrating what the Stoic
> philosophers called anacoluthia—the mutual entailment of the virtues. By this
> notion, no virtue is a virtue by itself. Rather, all virtues are entailed.
> Honesty without compassion, for example, becomes cruelty. We are, in effect,
> the sum of our complexities and contradictions. Practically, we must focus on
> building emotional capacity wherever it is that we are most out of balance.
> The ultimate goal is to move more freely and flexibly between our own
> opposites.

> “The greatest geniuses,” da Vinci told his patron, “sometimes accomplish more
> when they work less.” In his Treatise on Painting, da Vinci wrote, “It is a
> very good plan every now and then to go away and have a little relaxation. . .

> constantly at work will cause you to lose the power of judgment.”

> Five stages are now widely recognized: first insight, saturation, incubation,
> illumination and verification.

> The quantity of energy we have to spend at any given moment is a reflection of
> our physical capacity. Our motivation to spend what we have is largely a
> spiritual issue.

> Some activities generate considerable spiritual renewal without demanding
> significant energy expenditure. These include walking in nature, reading an
> inspirational book, listening to music, or hearing a great speaker. Spiritual
> practices, by contrast, can be renewing and demanding at the same time.
> Meditation, for example, requires mobilizing highly focused attention to quiet
> the mind, but may also prompt a rejuvenating experience of expansive openness,
> connectedness and even joy. Like yoga, meditation is a practice that can cut
> across all dimensions, building spiritual capacity while also providing mental
> and emotional recovery.

> inconvenience, but may also provide a profound source of meaning and deep

> The irony is that self-absorption ultimately drains energy and impedes
> performance. The more preoccupied we are with our own fears and concerns, the
> less energy we have available to take positive action. Subordinating our
> self-interest to something beyond ourselves may feel threatening at first, but
> as Gary discovered, it can also be immensely rewarding—a means by which to
> experience a deeper sense of meaning and greater self-worth. The commitment to
> live according to our deepest values not only creates a more stable center in
> our lives but also helps us to better navigate the challenges we face along
> the way.

> Nietzsche’s famous words, “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost
> any how.”

> we learned that visualizing a performance challenge in advance is a very
> effective way to allay anxiety and to perform without awkwardness or
> self-consciousness.

> Wade Roofs has defined spirituality as “knowing our deepest selves and what is
> sacred to us.”

> Arthur Ashe once put it: “From what we get in life, we make a living. From
> what we give, we make a life.”

> emotions such as fear, anger and even hatred can be a powerful source of
> energy. The problem is the cost. As we saw earlier, negative emotions drain
> energy and prompt the release of hormones that are toxic to our systems over
> time.

> Sometimes it’s more important to stay connected with people than to be right.”

> we feel more passion for and derive more pleasure from doing what we freely
> choose and most enjoy.

> capitolo *molto* bello. Deepest purpose.

> Purpose becomes a more powerful and enduring source of energy when its source
> moves from negative to positive, external to internal and self to others.

> When we aren’t investing energy in protecting our turf, we have the potential
> to see more of the truth and to continue to learn and grow.

> We can derive as much value from studying and understanding our failures as we
> can from celebrating and reinforcing our successes.

> “What amazes me most,” Roger told us, “is that once my values became clear and
> I got the hang of building rituals, most of the changes I made weren’t that
> hard. My life acquired a certain rhythm. I can feel how much my energy has
> rubbed off on the people in my life. My challenge now is just to feel the
> pulse and keep the beat.”
