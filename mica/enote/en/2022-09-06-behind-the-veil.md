# Behind the Veil: The Complete Guide to Conscious Sleep

> If you’re exercising Body, Mind, and Soul, you’re a complete human being; and as
> long as you’re capable of smoothly transitioning from your Gross to Subtle to
> Causal Bodies you’re a Veiler!

> (Delta). However, it’s possible, and even easy after a while, to remain alert
> even in this state of deep dreamless sleep. The Vedantists refer to this state
> as Turiya.

> one of the most potent techniques for inducing Lucidity is to imagine yourself
> at a point in space opposite that of your sleeping body (“Phasing”).

> our overall consciousness is like the sky in which the changing weather occurs.
> The problem is that we tend to identify with the changing weather and forget
> that we’re the unchanged sky.

> it ceases to be something that you do and becomes something that you are.

> One of the functions of dreaming is to inform the conscious mind of important
> issues happening below the threshold of awareness.

> “predicting the future” is just an expanded view of the present moment.

> take note of what you feel more than what you think about what you feel.

> What you’re driven to do versus how you believe you should conduct yourself is a
> source of tremendous waste of psychic energy. There’s a lot of truth in that old
> saying of Jesus: “If thine eye be single then thy whole body shall be filled
> with light.”

> fear is just a mask worn by wonder to test your readiness to enjoy her.

> you must pass through the Dream Plane to get to the Astral Plane. You’re making
> these transitions consciously and are therefore exposed to the phenomena of
> these liminal states.

> Unless you rewire yourself to make it happen, you won’t succeed.

> Like all trauma, one may sincerely wish to gain or regain access to the
> subtle-realms, but the reaction of fear can be so primal and visceral that any
> behind the Veil encounter is reflexively rejected by the very core of one’s
> self. Neurons that fire together wire together.

> The ability to remain conscious throughout the sleep cycle holds the key to all
> the treasures hidden behind the Veil!

> Huperzine before bedtime.

> Mugwort or Calea Zacatechichi just before bed can be an incredibly powerful OOBE

> Another great exercise for increasing memory requires nothing more than a rubber
> band and a commitment to practice. Place a rubber band on the wrist of your
> non-dominant hand. Next, choose a thought, word, or behavior that you tend to
> employ often, and make a mental note that you’ll avoid saying, thinking, or
> doing the chosen thing. Now, every time you slip, sharply snap the rubber band
> on your wrist. Not too hard! We’re not trying to punish ourselves. Rather, the
> goal here is to use this biofeedback device to encourage vigilance of mind. I’ve
> used this method for years and I promise that it works wonders!

> mentally retrace your steps in reverse, starting with putting away the groceries
> and ending with the trip to the store. It’s important to imagine as vividly as
> possible and to include all five senses in the visualization.

> while still lying in bed, gently turn your thoughts toward the prior night’s
> dreams. Please note the word “gently”! Dreams are composed of Etheric energy.
> Like all Etheric energy, if you become aggressive or tense, it will stagnate and
> prevent Dream Recall. Lastly, get out of bed gracefully with your mind still on
> last night’s dreams, and sit down comfortably with your journal.

> No detail is too small or insignificant that it shouldn’t be included in your
> journal entries.
> same holds true for Astral Projection.

> Similarly, if you consistently tell yourself before going to sleep that you must
> remain Lucid in your dreams, then you’ll eventually succeed in doing so. The
> same holds true for Astral Projection. It’s your consistent and firm intention
> to step behind the Veil that unlocks the mysteries behind the it!

> Zazen is usually translated as “sitting for Zen.” What exactly is Zen? Well, to
> put it plainly, Zen is the state where there’s no separation between what you’re
> doing, what you want to be doing, and who and where you are.

> The state of Trance is like a flame of attention burning in a windless room.

> intention isn’t the same thing as effort. An intention carries its own energy,
> and that energy has a movement all its own. Effort, on the other hand, is a form
> of tension. Obviously, there’s a place where effort is needed, but when it comes
> to attaining Trance, manipulating Qi, or going Astral, effort only gets in the
> way.

> notice that you’re not your thoughts. Rather, you’re the space in which thoughts
> are arising.

> the state of Trance is just deep dreamless sleep, but with one major exception:
> You’re aware! The Indian Sage, Ramana Maharshi, used to say of the search for
> the true Self that if it’s not present in deep dreamless sleep then it’s not
> real.

> first learn to have a complete in the body experience.

> Your Astral Body is intimately connected with your emotions.

> Channeling Intensity could rightly be called the art of just feeling.

> start by being vigilant and alert to yourself, particularly to your feeling
> self. I don’t just mean your emotions, but all your feeling.

> Next, don’t criticize, censor, or otherwise label what you’re feeling. Just
> allow it to be fully present without any preconceived idea of what you should or
> shouldn’t be feeling and how it should be dealt with. Also, notice your
> knee-jerk reactions to your feelings. Notice the almost instantaneous desire to
> repress, blame, express, hide, or excuse what you’re feeling. Simply let all of
> those reactions flower and self-liberate in your inner space. Metaphorically
> speaking, this is how you take the base lead of raw emotion and turn it into the
> gold of refined awareness.

> more space between you and this energy.
