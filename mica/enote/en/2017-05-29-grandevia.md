* Eat until 3/4 full.
* People can live eating 1/4, with other 3/4 live doctors.
* TRF (Time Restricted Feeding) is lowering by 30% Kcal income per meal.
* Fast 2 or 3 times a week. It is considered fasting:

    1. Eat raw/cooked vegetables (avoid potatoes) with dressing such as
       olive oil (1 tbs per meal a day), lemon or vinegar
       No cereals, fruits or proteins.
    1. Keep your stomach at rest at least 14 to 16 hours a day.

* Have a bit of hungry is good, our body produces an hormone called Ghrelin.
  Ghrelin gene products have several actions on acute and chronic inflammation
  and autoimmunity.

* Buckwheat can be used to make cornmeal mush
* Rye has lower glycemic load
* Soybean has more proteins than parmigiano
* Legumes raise HDL levels, you must eat them at least 2 or 4 times a week
* Raw rice and lentils is a balance dish
* Use malts and almond/hazelnut/sesame cremes together. Malts have high glycemia
  index but do not have fructose. Eat them with healthy fat as
  almon/hazelnut/sesame cremes decrease glucose absorption time. It useful eat
  them with legumes also.
* Daily salt upper bound: 2,4g
* Do not give sugar (in every form) to babies until 2 years old. White sugar if
  possible NEVER.
* Mother feeding during pregnancy will be liked to her baby too

* Calcium, tea, coffee, cocoa inhibits iron and zinc assimilation. Food with
  high levels of iron and zinc are grain cream, tahin, soy, azuki beans.
  Fermentation, sprouting and long leavening are practices that keep
  nutrients more assimilable
* Vitamin D help calcium absorption. Calcium can be found in high quantities
  into turnip greens, cabbage (40-60% in comparison to only 30% in cow milk),
  legumes (eg: soy), figs.
* In order to assimilate as much as possible nutrients from lettuce, use olive
  oil as dressing and add wild herbs such as lemon balm, mint, marjoram.
* Pan-fry (with olive oil) vegetables in order to better assimilate carotenoids.
  Carotenoids:
      - alpha e beta carotene: green leaf or yellow vegetables
      - lycopene: tomatoes, peanuts
      - beta criptoxantina: pumpkin
      - lutein: cabbage
      - capsanthin: chili pepper, red pepper, paprika
      - crocin: saffron

  steamed) Pan-fry cabbage enhance his nutrients, same with onion.

  dancing, swimming and skiing

  inside this time slot
* Exercises and weight loss increase HDL levels
* Exercises produce catepsina B useful in cognitive functions and memory
* Heart rate upper bound is: 220 - age
* HIT(High Interval Training) = switch between high intensive exercises (60s
  90/85% max heart rate) with resting periods (60s). Do it 10 times per row
  Do not exceed 5/10 minutes of work. Metabolic effects are the same as long
  training sessions of aerobic exercises (100 minutes)

* You don't need to be in a temple or have particular things, nothing will
  follow you up
* Yoga stages (by Patañjali):

  are enough. For a much longer exposure sunscreen is needed. During winter
  before 10am and after 4pm UVB ray can't go beyond ozone layer. It is useful
  sunbathing between 10am and 4pm. A dietary supplement of 800-1000 UI per day
  can be helpful (in winter).
