<blockquote>
<p>“The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to
information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer.
Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Overconfidence is fed by the illusory certainty of hindsight. My views on this
topic have been influenced by Nassim Taleb, the author of The Black Swan. I
hope for watercooler conversations that intelligently explore the lessons that
can be learned from the past while resisting the lure of hindsight and the
illusion of certainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be
blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you know that the lines are equally long. If asked about their length, you
will say what you know. But you still see the bottom line as longer. You have
chosen to believe the measurement, but you cannot prevent System 1 from doing
its thing; you cannot decide to see the lines as equal, although you know they
are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all illusions are visual. There are illusions of thought, which we call
cognitive illusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a way to live your life, however, continuous vigilance is not necessarily
good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking
would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to
serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we
can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are
likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.
The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s
mistakes than our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the pupil was a good measure of the physical arousal that accompanies mental
effort, and we could go ahead and use it to understand how the mind works.
Much like the electricity meter outside your house or apartment, the pupils
offer an index of the current rate at which mental energy is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Any task that requires you to keep several ideas in mind at the same time has
the same hurried character. Unless you have the good fortune of a capacious
working memory, you may be forced to work uncomfortably hard. The most
effortful forms of slow thinking are those that require you to think fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done
more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the
name he proposed for it, flow, has become part of the language. People who
experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep
that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and
their descriptions of the joy of that state are so compelling that
Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices,
use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body,
and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the
currency of glucose. When you are actively involved in difficult cognitive
reasoning or engaged in a task that requires self-control, your blood glucose
level drops. The effect is analogous to a runner who draws down glucose stored
in her muscles during a sprint. The bold implication of this idea is that the
effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or
less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The
phenomenon has been named ego depletion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe
arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If
System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find
relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called “engaged.” They
are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with
superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions. The
psychologist Keith Stanovich would call them more rational.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As cognitive scientists have emphasized in recent years, cognition is
embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This remarkable priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is
known as the ideomotor effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you feel
amused.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: you are
likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition,
because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All this is very good advice, but we should not get carried away. High-quality
paper, bright colors, and rhyming or simple language will not be much help if
your message is obviously nonsensical, or if it contradicts facts that your
audience knows to be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>performance was better with the bad font.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Zajonc argued that the effect of repetition on liking is a profoundly
important biological fact, and that it extends to all animals. To survive in a
frequently dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel
stimulus, with withdrawal and fear. Survival prospects are poor for an animal
that is not suspicious of novelty. However, it is also adaptive for the
initial caution to fade if the stimulus is actually safe. The mere exposure
effect occurs, Zajonc claimed, because the repeated exposure of a stimulus is
followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety
signal, and safety is good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable
and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the connection makes biological sense. A good mood is a signal that things are
generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let
one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well,
there may be a threat, and vigilance is required. Cognitive ease is both a
cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have norms for a vast number of categories, and these norms provide the
background for the immediate detection of anomalies</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a large event is supposed to have consequences, and consequences need causes
to explain them. We have limited information about what happened on a day, and
System 1 is adept at finding a coherent causal story that links the fragments
of knowledge at its disposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we are born prepared to make intentional attributions: infants under one year
old identify bullies and victims, and expect a pursuer to follow the most
direct path in attempting to catch whatever it is chasing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. System 1
is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and
unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy. Indeed, there is
evidence that people are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive
messages, such as commercials, when they are tired and depleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things
you have not observed—is known as the halo effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gilbert proposed that understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to
believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only
then can you decide whether or not to unbelieve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>simple rule can help: before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee
should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position. This procedure
makes good use of the value of the diversity of knowledge and opinion in the
group.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an
understanding of intuitive thinking, and comes up so often in this book, that
I will use a cumbersome abbreviation for it: WYSIATI, which stands for what
you see is all there is. System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality
and the quantity of the information that gives rise to impressions and
intuitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not
its completeness. Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it
easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we encounter a new aptitude of System 1. An underlying scale of intensity
allows matching across diverse dimensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>assessment. You do that automatically whether or not you</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you often have answers to questions that you do not completely understand,
relying on evidence that you can neither explain nor defend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How to Solve It: “If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier
problem you can solve: find it.” Pólya’s heuristics are strategic procedures
that are deliberately implemented by System 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions
are involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“people are not adequately sensitive to sample size.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The
exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few
observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get
that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you follow your intuition, you will more often than not err by
misclassifying a random event as systematic. We are far too willing to reject
the belief that much of what we see in life is random.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an
unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the
most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates
stay close to the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is clear: anchors do not have their effects because people
believe they are informative.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My advice to students when I taught negotiations was that if you think the
other side has made an outrageous proposal, you should not come back with an
equally outrageous counteroffer, creating a gap that will be difficult to
bridge in further negotiations. Instead you should make a scene, storm out or
threaten to do so, and make it clear—to yourself as well as to the other
side—that you will not continue the negotiation with that number on the table.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good
defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment
of thoughts that produces these effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are always aware of the anchor and even pay attention to it, but you do
not know how it guides and constrains your thinking, because you cannot
imagine how you would have thought if the anchor had been different (or
absent). However, you should assume that any number that is on the table has
had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize
yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kunreuther also observed that protective actions, whether by individuals or
governments, are usually designed to be adequate to the worst disaster
actually experienced.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality; our expectations
about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional
intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slovic has challenged the foundation of their expertise: the idea that risk is
objective. “Risk” does not exist “out there,” independent of our minds and
culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of
“risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of
life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as “real risk”
or “objective risk.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every parent who has stayed up waiting for a teenage daughter who is late from
a party will recognize the feeling. You may know that there is really (almost)
nothing to worry about, but you cannot help images of disaster from coming to
mind. As Slovic has argued, the amount of concern is not adequately sensitive
to the probability of harm; you are imagining the numerator—the tragic story
you saw on the news—and not thinking about the denominator. Sunstein has
coined the phrase “probability neglect” to describe the pattern. The
combination of probability neglect with the social mechanisms of availability
cascades inevitably leads to gross exaggeration of minor threats, sometimes
with important consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mechanism through which biases flow into policy: the availability cascade.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base
rate. Question the diagnosticity of your evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>individuals feel relieved of responsibility when they know that others have
heard the same request for help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Changing one’s mind about human nature is hard work, and changing one’s mind
for the worse about oneself is even harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Subjects’ unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched
only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own
behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>correlation and regression are not two concepts—they are different
perspectives on the same concept. The general rule is straightforward but has
surprising consequences: whenever the correlation between two scores is
imperfect, there will be regression to the mean. To</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to conclude that an energy drink—or any other treatment—is effective,
you must compare a group of patients who receive this treatment to a “control
group” that receives no treatment (or, better, receives a placebo).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>general limitation of the human mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct
past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new
view of the world (or of any part of it), you immediately lose much of your
ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, people who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a
particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys who
would have distributed their choices evenly over the options. Even in the
region they knew best, experts were not significantly better than
nonspecialists. Those who know more forecast very slightly better than those
who know less. But those with the most knowledge are often less reliable. The
reason is that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced
illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first lesson is that errors of prediction are inevitable because the world
is unpredictable. The second is that high subjective confidence is not to be
trusted as an indicator of accuracy (low confidence could be more
informative).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Several studies have shown that human decision makers are inferior to a
prediction formula even when they are given the score suggested by the
formula!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to
information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer.
Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the
environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when a project ends reasonably well: once you understand the main conclusion,
it seems it was always obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>how can we evaluate the probable validity of an intuitive judgment? When do
judgments reflect true expertise? When do they display an illusion of
validity? The answer comes from the two basic conditions for acquiring a
skill: an environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable an
opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the likelihood that something will go wrong in a big project is high.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>people who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to
know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs. When we were
eventually exposed to the outside view, we collectively ignored it. We can
recognize what happened to us; it is similar to the experiment that suggested
the futility of teaching psychology. When they made predictions about
individual cases about which they had a little information (a brief and bland
interview), Nisbett and Borgida’s students completely neglected the global
results they had just learned. “Pallid” statistical information is routinely
discarded when it is incompatible with one’s personal impressions of a case.
In the competition with the inside view, the outside view doesn’t stand a
chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bent Flyvbjerg, now at Oxford University, offered a forceful summary: The
prevalent tendency to underweight or ignore distributional information is
perhaps the major source of error in forecasting. Planners should therefore
make every effort to frame the forecasting problem so as to facilitate
utilizing all the distributional information that is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for failing to allow for difficulties that they could not have anticipated—the
unknown unknowns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>call it theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory and used it
as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its
flaws. If you come upon an observation that does not seem to fit the model,
you assume that there must be a perfectly good explanation that you are
somehow missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You just like winning and dislike losing—and you almost certainly dislike
losing more than you like winning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The slope of the function is steeper in the negative domain; the response to a
loss is stronger than the response to a corresponding gain. This was the
explanation of the endowment effect that Thaler had been searching for. And
the first application of prospect theory to an economic puzzle now appears to
have been a significant milestone in the development of behavioral economics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>paper titled “Bad Is Stronger Than Good,” summarized the evidence as follows:
“Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones,
and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more
motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad
impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to
disconfirmation than good ones.” They cite John Gottman, the well-known expert
in marital relations, who observed that the long-term success of a
relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the
positive. Gottman estimated that a stable relationship requires that good
interactions outnumber bad interactions by at least 5 to 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Loss aversion refers to the relative strength of two motives: we are driven
more strongly to avoid losses than to achieve gains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Animals, including people, fight harder to prevent losses than to achieve
gains. In the world of territorial animals, this principle explains the
success of defenders. A biologist observed that “when a territory holder is
challenged by a rival, the owner almost always wins the contest—usually within
a matter of seconds.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>von Neumann and Morgenstern introduced in 1944. They proved that any weighting
of uncertain outcomes that is not strictly proportional to probability leads
to inconsistencies and other disasters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My experience illustrates how terrorism works and why it is so effective: it
induces an availability cascade.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The psychology of high-prize lotteries is similar to the psychology of
terrorism. The thrilling possibility of winning the big prize is shared by the
community and reinforced by conversations at work and at home. Buying a ticket
is immediately rewarded by pleasant fantasies, just as avoiding a bus was
immediately rewarded by relief from fear. In both cases, the actual
probability is inconsequential; only possibility matters. The original
formulation of prospect theory included the argument that “highly unlikely
events are either ignored or overweighted,” but it did not specify the
conditions under which one or the other will occur, nor did it propose a
psychological interpretation of it. My current view of decision weights has
been strongly influenced by recent research on the role of emotions and
vividness in decision making. Overweighting of unlikely outcomes is rooted in
System 1 features that are familiar by now. Emotion and vividness influence
fluency, availability, and judgments of probability—and thus account for our
excessive response to the few rare events that we do not ignore.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People overestimate the probabilities of unlikely events. People overweight
unlikely events in their decisions. Although overestimation and overweighting
are distinct phenomena, the same psychological mechanisms are involved in
both: focused attention, confirmation bias, and cognitive ease.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The common feature of these poignant stories is that they involve unusual
events—and unusual events are easier than normal events to undo in
imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An abnormal event attracts attention, and it also activates the idea of the
event that would have been normal under the same circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Losses are weighted about twice as much as gains in several contexts: choice
between gambles, the endowment effect, and reactions to price changes. The
loss-aversion coefficient is much higher in some situations. In particular,
you may be more loss averse for aspects of your life that are more important
than money, such as health. Furthermore, your reluctance to “sell” important
endowments increases dramatically when doing so might make you responsible for
an awful outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also take precautions that will inoculate you against regret. Perhaps
the most useful is to be explicit about the anticipation of regret. If you can
remember when things go badly that you considered the possibility of regret
carefully before deciding, you are likely to experience less of it. You should
also know that regret and hindsight bias will come together, so anything you
can do to preclude hindsight is likely to be helpful. My personal
hindsight-avoiding policy is to be either very thorough or completely casual
when making a decision with long-term consequences. Hindsight is worse when
you think a little, just enough to tell yourself later, “I almost made a
better choice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the emotion evoked by a word can “leak” into the final choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the experience was not actually ruined, only the memory of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What we learn from the past is to maximize the qualities of our future
memories, not necessarily of our future experience. This is the tyranny of the
remembering self.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tastes and decisions are shaped by memories, and the memories can be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>story is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time
passing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Duration neglect is normal in a story, and the ending often defines its
character. The same core features appear in the rules of narratives and in the
memories of colonoscopies, vacations, and films. This is how the remembering
self works: it composes stories and keeps them for future reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction of memories.
Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy the moment, even if it is not
very memorable?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Csikszentmihalyi calls flow—a state that some artists experience in their
creative moments and that many other people achieve when enthralled by a film,
a book, or a crossword puzzle: interruptions are not welcome in any of these
situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>focusing illusion, which can be described in a single sentence: Nothing in
life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that duration is important, but our memory tells us it is not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans, unlike Econs, need help to make good decisions, and there are informed
and unintrusive ways to provide that help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle:
recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask
for reinforcement from System 2.</p>
