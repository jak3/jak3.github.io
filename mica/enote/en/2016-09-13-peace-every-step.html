<blockquote>
<p>Every time you do an activity, or have a thought, you are changing a piece of yourself into something slightly different than it was before. Every hour you spend with others, you become more like the people around you. Gradually, you become a different person. If there is a large gap between your daily conduct and your core commitment, you will become more like your daily activities and less attached to your original commitment.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if we can only quiet our distracted thinking long enough to come back to the present moment and notice the blue sky, the child’s smile, the beautiful sunrise. “If we are peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile, and everyone in our family, our entire society, will benefit from our peace.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>mind and body are not unified. By concentrating on our breathing, “In” and “Out,” we bring body and mind back together, and become whole again. Conscious breathing is an important bridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we are in the city, the countryside, or the wilderness, we need to sustain ourselves by choosing our surroundings carefully and nourishing our awareness in each moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to practice meditation gently, but steadily, throughout daily life, not wasting a single opportunity or event to see deeply into the true nature of life, including our everyday problems. Practicing in this way, we dwell in profound communion with life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We have to learn to really enjoy our church bells and our school bells. Bells are beautiful, and they can wake us up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything is still there, and if you really want it, you can find it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You become a bodhisattva, helping a living being become enlightened. Children, in particular, are very capable of practicing mindfulness and reminding others to do the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By taking good care of the present moment, we take good care of the future. Working for peace in the future is to work for peace in the present moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>has become a kind of habit to look at things with the intention of getting something. We call it “pragmatism,” and we say that the truth is something that pays. If we meditate in order to get to the truth, it seems we will be well paid. In meditation, we stop, and we look deeply. We stop just to be there, to be with ourselves and with the world. When we are capable of stopping, we begin to see and, if we can see, we understand. Peace and happiness are the fruit of this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we just act in each moment with composure and mindfulness, each minute of our life is a work of art. Even when we are not painting or writing, we are still creating. We are pregnant with beauty, joy, and peace, and we are making life more beautiful for many people. Sometimes it is better not to talk about art by using the word “art.” If we just act with awareness and integrity, our art will flower, and we don’t have to talk about it at all. When we know how to be peace, we find that art is a wonderful way to share our peacefulness. Artistic expression will take place in one way or another, but the being is essential. So we must go back to ourselves, and when we have joy and peace in ourselves, our creations of art will be quite natural, and they will serve the world in a positive way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I think deeply about the nature of hope, I see something tragic. Since we cling to our hope in the future, we do not focus our energies and capabilities on the present moment. We use hope to believe something better will happen in the future, that we will arrive at peace, or the Kingdom of God. Hope becomes a kind of obstacle. If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not mean that you should not have hope, but that hope is not enough. Hope can create an obstacle for you, and if you dwell in the energy of hope, you will not bring yourself back entirely into the present moment. If you re-channel those energies into being aware of what is going on in the present moment, you will be able to make a breakthrough and discover joy and peace right in the present moment, inside of yourself and all around you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone holds up a flower and shows it to you, he wants you to see it. If you keep thinking, you miss the flower. The person who was not thinking, who was just himself, was able to encounter the flower in depth, and he smiled. That is the problem of life. If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. We are neither drowned in nor terrorized by the feeling, nor do we reject it. Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. If we face our unpleasant feelings with care, affection, and nonviolence, we can transform them into the kind of energy that is healthy and has the capacity to nourish us. By the work of mindful observation, our unpleasant feelings can illuminate so much for us, offering us insight and understanding into ourselves and society.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of acting as if we can dispose of parts of ourselves, we should learn the art of transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we become angry at our anger, we will have two angers at the same time. We only have to observe it with love and attention. If we take care of our anger in this way, without trying to run away from it, it will transform itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in dealing with feelings is to recognize each feeling as it arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You calm your feeling just by being with it, like a mother tenderly holding her crying baby.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second step is to become one with the feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The third step is to calm the feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fourth step is to release the feeling, to let it go.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fifth step is to look deeply.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you will know what to do and what not to do to transform the feeling and be free.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is best if we do not listen to or look at the person whom we consider to be the cause of our anger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need the insight and non-dual vision of the organic gardener with regard to our anger. We need not be afraid of it or reject it. We know that anger can be a kind of compost, and that it is within its power to give birth to something beautiful. We need anger in the way the organic gardener needs compost. If we know how to accept our anger, we already have some peace and joy. Gradually we can transform anger completely into peace, love, and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>our anger will subside and we will feel stronger. Then we can begin to observe the anger directly and try to understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the illuminating light of awareness, after practicing mindful observation for a while, we begin to see the primary causes of our anger. Meditation helps us look deeply into things in order to see their nature. If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. These roots can be present in ourselves and in the person who played the principal role in precipitating our anger. We observe mindfully in order to be able to see and to understand. Seeing and understanding are the elements of liberation that bring about love and compassion. The method of mindful observation in order to see and understand the roots of the anger is a method that has lasting effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The absence of clear understanding is the basis for every knot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a term in Buddhist psychology that can be translated as “internal formations,” “fetters,” or “knots.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Internal formations need our full attention as soon as they manifest, while they are still weak, so that the work of transformation is easy. If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In psychology, this is called resistance. We are afraid to bring into our conscious mind the feelings of pain that are buried in us, because they will make us suffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>they are not considered in relation to our real problems, our meditation is not really very valuable or helpful. If we know how to live every moment in an awakened way, we will be aware of what is going on in our feelings and perceptions in the present moment, and we will not let knots form or become tighter in our consciousness. And if we know how to observe our feelings, we can find the roots of long-standing internal formations and transform them, even those that have become quite strong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>realized that if I didn’t do something about the anger in me, I would transmit it to my children.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>three components: the giver, the gift, and the one who receives the gift. The giver is our parents; we are the continuation of our parents and our ancestors. The gift is our body itself. The one who receives the gift is us. As we continue to meditate on this, we see clearly that the giver, the gift, and the receiver are one. All three are present in our body. When we are deeply in touch with the present moment, we can see that all our ancestors and all future generations are present in us. Seeing this, we will know what to do and what not to do—for ourselves, our ancestors, our children, and their children.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consciousness exists on two levels: as seeds and as manifestations of these seeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of us needs a reserve of seeds that are beautiful, healthy, and strong enough to help us during difficult moments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. Wherever we are, any time, we have the capacity to enjoy the sunshine, the presence of each other, the wonder of our breathing. We don’t have to travel anywhere else to do so. We can be in touch with these things right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we cannot love. We must look deeply in order to see and understand the needs, aspirations, and suffering of the person we love. This is the ground of real love. You cannot resist loving another person when you really understand him or her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>True love needs understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To look deeply is to understand. Once we understand the reasons he has acted badly, our bitterness towards him will vanish, and we will long for him to suffer less. We will feel cool and light, and we can smile. We do not need the other person to be present in order to bring about reconciliation. When we look deeply, we become reconciled with ourselves, and, for us, the problem no longer exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can get in touch with the refreshing, healing elements within and around us thanks to the loving support of other people. If we have a good community of friends, we are very fortunate. To create a good community, we first have to transform ourselves into a good element of the community. After that, we can go to another person and help him or her become an element of the community. We build our network of friends that way. We have to think of friends and community as investments, as our most important asset. They can comfort us and help us in difficult times, and they can share our joy and happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mindfulness must be engaged. Once there is seeing, there must be acting. Otherwise, what is the use of seeing?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is made of non-wealth elements, and poverty is made by non-poverty elements. It is exactly the same as with the sheet of paper. So we must be careful not to imprison ourselves in concepts. The truth is that everything contains everything else. We cannot just be, we can only inter-be. We are responsible for everything that happens around us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a mountain climber or someone who enjoys the countryside, or the green forest, you know that the forests are our lungs outside of our bodies, just as the sun is our heart outside of our bodies. Yet we have been acting in a way that has allowed two million square miles of forest land to be destroyed by acid rain, and we have destroyed parts of the ozone layer that regulate how much direct sunlight we receive. We are imprisoned in our small selves, thinking only of the comfortable conditions for this small self, while we destroy our large self. We should be able to be our true self. That means we should be able to be the river, we should be able to be the forest, the sun, and the ozone layer. We must do this to understand and to have hope for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Awareness of this fact alone can help us overcome many of our own psychological pains. Eventually our contemplations can help us see how to assist those who need our help so much.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need harmony, we need peace. Peace is based on respect for life, the spirit of reverence for life. Not only do we have to respect the lives of human beings, but we have to respect the lives of animals, vegetables, and minerals. Rocks can be alive. A rock can be destroyed. The Earth also. The destruction of our health by pollution of the air and water is linked to the destruction of the minerals. The way we farm, the way we deal with our garbage, all these things are related to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot just blame one side or the other. We have to transcend the tendency to take sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked the leaf whether it was frightened because it was autumn and the other leaves were falling. The leaf told me, “No. During the whole spring and summer I was completely alive. I worked hard to help nourish the tree, and now much of me is in the tree. I am not limited by this form. I am also the whole tree, and when I go back to the soil, I will continue to nourish the tree. So I don’t worry at all. As I leave this branch and float to the ground, I will wave to the tree and tell her, ‘I will see you again very soon.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What we need are people who are capable of loving, of not taking sides so that they can embrace the whole of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked the question, how could people live like this when things are like that? But if you stay in Paris for ten years without being in touch, you find it normal. Meditation is a point of contact. Sometimes you do not have to go to the place of suffering. You just sit quietly on your cushion, and you can see everything. You can actualize everything, and you can be aware of what is going on in the world. Out of that kind of awareness, compassion and understanding arise naturally, and you can stay right in your own country and perform social action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All systems of thought are guiding means; they are not absolute truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid being narrow-minded and bound to present views. Learn and practice non-attachment from views in order to be open to receive others’ viewpoints. Truth is found in life and not merely in conceptual knowledge. Be ready to learn throughout your entire life and to observe reality in yourself and in the world at all times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon as anger or hatred arises, turn your attention to your breathing in order to see and understand the nature of your anger or hatred and the nature of the persons who have caused your anger or hatred.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>9 Do not say untruthful things for the sake of personal interest or to impress people. Do not utter words that cause division and hatred. Do not spread news that you do not know to be certain. Do not criticize or condemn things that you are not sure of. Always speak truthfully and constructively. Have the courage to speak out about situations of injustice, even when doing so may threaten your own safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>14 Do not mistreat your body. Learn to handle it with respect. Do not look on your body as only an instrument. Preserve vital energies for the realization of the Way. Sexual expression should not happen without love and commitment. In sexual relationships, be aware of future suffering that may be caused. To preserve the happiness of others, respect the rights and commitments of others. Be fully aware of the responsibility of bringing new lives into the world. Meditate on the world into which you are bringing new beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The next morning when the sun was in the sky, she discovered something beautiful. She saw the blue sky for the first time. She had never noticed it before. She had only been interested in clouds, and she had missed seeing the sky, which is the home of all the clouds. Clouds are impermanent, but the sky is stable. She realized that the immense sky had been within her heart since the very beginning. This great insight brought her peace and happiness. As she saw the vast wonderful blue sky, she knew that her peace and stability would never be lost again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the hand of your child and invite her to go out and sit with you on the grass. The two of you may want to contemplate the green grass, the little flowers that grow among the grasses, and the sky. Breathing and smiling together—that is peace education. If we know how to appreciate these beautiful things, we will not have to search for anything else. Peace is available in every moment, in every breath, in every step.</p>
