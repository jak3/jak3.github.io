<p>This blog is born with the intention to became a collection of phrases,
advices, thoughts, aphorisms and pearls of wisdom that I have caught from
lectures, books and online post. It can be seen as a self-reference <em>e-</em>notecard system. More about what a notecard system is can be found in an admirably <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/">post by Ryan Holiday</a>.</p>

<p>Addicted readers must have a look to <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/">his blog</a>.</p>

<p>I have chosen an electronic version for different reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>It is really fast to find something</li>
  <li>Can be shared</li>
  <li>You can keep it with you pretty much everywhere</li>
  <li>Resist much better to bad weather ;)</li>
</ol>
